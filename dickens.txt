When I was a kid, we had two dogs: a Pyrenean Shepherd, and a Labrador Retriever. The Retriever was a goofy idiot, but the Shepherd was *smart*.

One day, the Retriever gets loose (we had to tie him up in the yard because he kept chasing things and running away), and the Shepherd runs after him. We never even realized what had happened until we saw the Shepherd coming back with the Retriever, holding the would-be runaway's leash in his mouth, and leading him back to the house. 

Must have been a weird sight for the neighbors.

I used to have a border collie/German Shepherd mix named ash. We had a 6 foot chain link fence with about an acre-sized backyard for him to roam freely. One day, we couldn’t find him and an hour later he was back in the yard. As his escapes happened more often, I decided to watch him from the window. He would stick his front paws in the fence, pull himself up so his lower legs went in the fence, then put his front paws on top of the fence and climb over it like a goddamn human. He could do it from the other side as well and never hurt himself doing it. I was so impressed I wasn’t even mad at him when he continued doing it for the remainder of his life. He was the smartest animal I ever had. 
NEXT
I had a genius ferret.  All of my ferrets were smarter than you might expect, but Mia was ridiculous.  I have tons of stories, but here’s my favourite.

My roommates and I used to hangout in a TV room that had door way with no door (entranceway?).  Since I wanted the ferret to be able to run around while we were there, I put a baby gate across the exit.  Took her ten seconds to climb it, of course.

I then wrapped the gate in carpet runner, so she couldn’t scale it.  She tried for a long time, but could find anything to get a grip on.  Three of us are all kind of marveling at her commitment. 

She stops trying to climb, and just freezes for a minute, her eyes panning around the room like she’s concocting a scheme, and then she starts eyeballing a shoebox on the other side of the room.  Eyes up on the gate, back to the box, back to the gate.  My buddy says “No fucking way.  You think she’s figured it out?”

She walks over to the box and starts sliding it across the floor, stopping every foot or so and checking her progress.  Finally gets to the gate, hops on the box and jumps up and grabs the top of the gate.  Whoop she’s up and over and dancing down the hallway.

We used to have this dog when I was younger, she learned how to open our fridge and she would eat almost everything in it. It got so bad that my mom had to buy a child proof lock for our fridge, she ran a daycare so it was always funny when parents asked about it and she had to explain it was for our dog and not the daycare kids.

A couple years ago, my grandmother who doesn’t walk very well anymore fell while walking in the living room. 

They have a plot of land so it’s pretty big and a couple of my family members live there, but at that time nobody was home. When our dog found out my grandmother fell, he ran all around to look for another person. When he didn’t find anyone, he lay down and sat with her until she found the strength to stand up again. She told the whole family and I think we were all a little more thankful he was there for her that day.

My cat is a fucking sadist. She has learned my work/school schedule and if I'm not getting up in the morning, she will step on the button of my CPAP machine, causing me took choke and wake up. If I have a panic attack, she meows until I pick her up and pet her, until I calm down.

I have a German Shepherd that will let me know he’s about to vomit and needs to be let out by nudging my legs, licking his lips, and then running to the back door. I’m so thankful he’s learned to try to hold in his vomit so he won’t do it in the house

My cat gets really ashamed when he hacks up a hairball.  He will sit there looking very sad until its cleaned up.   Well one day I was at work when he threw one up, and since there was nobody in the house to clean it up for him, he tried to clean/cover it up it on his own.  He found one of my dirty socks I kicked off the day before, unrolled it, and then neatly placed it over the hairball.  I still ended up stepping in it though...

I once had a dog that would look both ways before crossing the street. She was legitimately looking for oncoming traffic.  One time she started to cross, but then saw a car coming. She backed off, and only crossed after the car passed.

On the other hand, I once had a dog who would sun bath in the middle of the street. Literally in the middle, as to block traffic in both directions.

We have smooth wood floors that can be kind of slippery in socks. One night I took a corner too fast, slipped, and went down hard. I wasn't hurt, just sorta stunned so I just stayed on the floor for a second (I was belly-side down, but propped up on my elbow). When I didn't get up right away, my dog leapt over the couch to get to me, wiggled her body under mine then stood up, so that she was kind of lifting my body up on hers. I'm not sure if it was at all her intention, but I like to think she was trying to help me. As soon as I got up on my own, she proceeded to tackle me and frantically lick my face in celebration. :)

Edit: Thanks for the upvotes! Since she basically saved my life I thought I'd add in a [picture of my good pupper] enjoying some dirt. Further proof that this is the smartest thing she's done!

Was in the middle of packing to move and one of us forgot to close the hamster cage. Hammy gets out and is running around. Cat notices hammy and makes this loud strange meow that wakes us up and alerts us to the loose hamster.

One time my dog had a minor blockage and we took him to the emergency vet to see what we could do. The vet decided to give him some fluids to try to flush it out. Later that night he woke me up by punching me in the face and looked deeply into my eyes as if to say “this is going to be a photo finish.” Let him outside and he let out the biggest poop I had ever witnessed him take. Thanks for not doing that in the house buddy.

My male quaker parrot managed to get out of his cage one day and had free roam over the entire house.  He stole every pen, pencil, and hair tie he could find and built a nest in the corner of his cage.

When we tried to take it down he guarded it with his life and screeched at us.  We got him a few boxes of pencils the next day and let him remodel as much as he wanted.

Honestly he loved building it and fixing it up, it kept him busy and happy.

My cat has this thing about drinking water from a bowl. She would always tip it over lick it off the floor. 

We got tired of stepping on a wet floor in socks on the daily so we wedged the water bowl between two heavier objects so that she couldn't tip it over. 

She realized she could get a running start to jump onto a rolling office chair to create enough force to move the bowl enough to spill it onto the floor. 

I feel like she has a pretty good grasp on simple physics and using tools to get her way.

Edit: this was a couple of years ago and I did end up getting her a little fountain to drink from! She and her little sister have their own fountain and we haven't had any issues since.

One of my pet rats was kinda smart. When they would walk around on my bed, they were able to step onto the windowsill. I used to have blinds in front of my window, and the little cord hung over it down to the ground. At the end of the cord there was this little weight.

So my pet rat tried to lift the cord upward, but when of course it kept falling back down because of the little weight. He thought for a minute, and then lifted the cord again, put his front paw on the cord, gripped another part of the cord with his teeth, lifted it upward a little further, put his paw on top of it, etc. He managed to get the rest of the cord and little weight on the windowsill. He did that every day after that.

I thought that was pretty smart. 

Also, I used to have 2 rats that could spin around their axis on command. They knew they would get a snack if they did that.
So whenever I opened a bag of potato chips (for myself!) They started spinning around like 10 times hoping they would get some. I never give my rats chips, for the record.

Our late Italian Greyhound Elon got baths every week due to “THE STENCH” (his nickname was “The Stink”). One time, we were both sick with sinus infections and it had been about two weeks since Elon had gotten his bath. We were sitting on the sofa watching TV as a family, and Elon gets up off the couch and trots down the hall. This happened often, so we didn’t move. We then heard his nails on a different surface than we’d ever heard previously. Perplexed, his Dad and I went down the hall to find him standing in the bathtub staring at us like, “People I can smell myself. It’s time.”

The smartest thing I've seen my cat do is referee when my girlfriend's kitten was trying to fight her older cat. We were initially terrified because my cat was found as a stray and you can tell that he's had his ass kicked in a few fights back in the day.

When we adopted him, when he'd hear the other cats start playfighting, he'd rush out to be there too. He weighed about twice as much as the next biggest cat, and we knew almost nothing about his personality at the time, so of course this filled us with terror. Well, we followed him out into the next room, and he had just managed to perch himself on the coffee table, above the action, and was just watching.

When the older cat switched from playing to getting genuinely exasperated with the kitten, he tagged in so the other cat could get away. For months he would do this, so we figured he may have helped raise kittens when he was stray.

Anyway, his personality is great, and he's a sweet dumb boy and the best lap cat you could ask for. The vet at the shelter thought he would want to be an outside cat, but once we got him home it was very plain that that was not the case. I could leave the door open all day and he wouldn't go anywhere; this cat has no interest in being outdoors again.

I'm babbling but the point is I love this dumb boi.

I have a blood parrot, smartest fish I've ever had. His tank contains half sand and half white pebbles. However he's very particular with where and how the floor of his environment looks like. For example, he'll move plants towards certain places if he doesn't like how the ground looks beneath them. He'll place pebbles on the sand part, and make a sand pile in the pebbles area. But it isn't random, if you remove a pebble from a little pile, he'll notice it and place another one. If you destort a little sand pile, he'll build more ontop of the remains. He'll spend about three days carving out a small hole just to see his reflection at the bottom of the tank. If you lightly dusty the empty space with sand, he'll come swimming out of his 'house,' collect the misplaced sand in his mouth and literally throw it at you against the aquarium glass. He's a very grumpy fish, but his personality is amazing!

I've got an African Grey parrot. I also have a large mirror that leans against a wall. He once walked up to it, studied the other bird intensely after fluffing up and acting like a badass. Then he decided to look behind the mirror for the other bird. Except you could see the confusion when he popped his head behind there only to see nothing. He then looked at me as if I caused this black magic. Then he proceeded to walk behind the mirror and poke his head around so he could look into the mirror while standing behind it. He then looked at me quizzically, studied the mirror, popped his head behind it, popped it back out to confirm, then just walked away. Now, he seems to check himself out in the mirror every time he waddles past it. I swear he knows it's him in the mirror and nit just that particular one. If he's in the bathroom with me, he acts the same and appears to be studying himself whenever he gets the chance.

Knowing that the reflection in a mirror is you is one of the rare abilities in the animal kingdom and one which few animals possess the required intelligence to understand. Dolphins, pigs, some of the higher level primates. That's about it. Most other animals can't put the connection together. 

He also used to taunt the cat and get him to jump on top of the bird's cage. Then he'd yell for us so we'd grab the cat and scold him. Then the bird would laugh. Happened until the cat learned not to jump on top of the cage. Now, he's scared of the bird and will turn around if he sees the bird walking towards him.

When my son was a baby, he was teething really bad. Constantly running a fever and cranky. we gave him lots of the tylenol suspension drops. One morning I had the baby wedged in the recliner while I was looking for something. Of course he was crying. Our dog, looked at the baby, ran upstairs, came back down a few seconds later with the tylenol, dropped it in the recliner where it rolled to the baby. Then the dog turned to me and barked until I picked it up.

One of my dogs would walk next to me without a leash and no matter what he would never bark or leave.
 All I did was give him attention and take good care of him, he learned all this stuff by observing my behavior.
 When one of my dogs died he would cry at night and one day I laid on the floor and slept next to him, he started crying even more until one day he became silent again.

My samoyed knows he can use his nose to turn off my Xbox and get my attention. He always gets a drink of water before going on a walk.

My Golden Retriever has created a game, we call it Brody-Ball. Basically he gets a tennis ball between his paws while he’s laying on the couch or bed, and slowly starts to nudge it towards the edge. Once it gets to a point where it’s balancing, he tries to stay perfectly still until it starts to fall. Once it starts to fall he either wins, by snagging the ball before it falls to the ground, or he loses, by failing to catch it and it falling off the couch/bed. I think he just did this to counteract the boredom he had when he was a lonely pup. 

Edit: Dogs name is Brody, hence the “Brody” in “Brody-Ball”!

My golden retriever leaves a shoe on the bed, without fail, for my wife or I to find if we are both gone at the same time.  My theory is that she did it once, and we came home, so now she does it every time we leave to ensure that we come back.  Like a doggy superstition.   

After doing this for years, my wife had to leave the state for a week.  My first day back from work, there was a shoe on the bed.  Normal.  After my second day back (wife is still gone), there were three shoes on the bed.  After my third day returning from work alone, every shoe and boot in the house was laid out on the bed and couches, and all of my wife's dirty socks were in a bowl.

It may not be the smartest thing she's ever done, but it really made me think about how she thinks.

This is a completely true story. Weird, but true, and shows a really impressive level of intelligence in my cat. It happened when I was a teenager.

I’m sitting on the couch, and my cat walks into the room and starts meowing loudly, but not coming to me. So I stand up and go toward him, and he starts walking away, so I follow. He leads me, meowing the whole way and looking back to make sure I’m following, to the bathroom. Weird, right? Just wait.

So we’re in the bathroom, and he hops up on the toilet and, get this, he PEES IN IT. I was floored. One, he peed in the toilet. Like a person. He’d never done that before. It’s impressive that he knew what a toilet was for. But two, he brought me there to show me. Why? This is where the real intelligence comes into it. 

Well, he stops peeing and turns to look into the toilet and then looks at me. So I look in the toilet. It’s full of blood. He had a terrible kidney infection (as the vet later confirmed), and this is how he told me.

Think of all the things he had to understand to do this!! He had to know he was sick and in which part of his body the infection was. He had to know that the bathroom was the place where I deal with the part of my body that matches up with his sick part. He had to know what a toilet was for and how to use it. And he knew that if I understood the problem, I’d be able to fix it. 

Seriously, that cat was incredible.

Maybe this is more just awww... but I also have a pug so you're not going to get rocket science from him. 

I moved back in with my dad for awhile between houses and he has a big pool. I decided to make the most of my summer and stocked up on books and a floaty lounger thing that had a pillow but was basically like pool noodles holding a net. I still insist this is the best pool reading lounger because you don't get too hot. 

Well the pug likes to snuggle. He also can't handle a Missouri summer so he can't be outside for long. Dad let him out because he was crying and he finds me in the pool. I'm like... no dude, there are no snuggles here. 

Well, you could see him thinking about this situation. He sat for a few minutes and just looked at me. Then he jumped in, paddled over,  got up on the lounger with his body in the water (on the net still, but because of how this works, you're supported but submerged in that makes sense. He propped his head on my belly and proceeds to fall asleep snuggling. 

So that's how we spent our summer. He figured out a way to combat heat and pool just to sleep with his head on me. It might not be smart smart... but he had a will and found a way.

At the end of a peanut butter jar I give it to my Doberman to lick the inside out. But it’s kinda hard for him to hold the jar still and also have the right angle, so one time he found a high top shoe of mine and set the jar in it so it would stand up right while he licked it clean. I was sure it was a weird coincidence but since then he always goes looking for my work boots when I give him a peanut butter jar, he’ll even set the boot upright if it’s knocked over then proceed to insert the jar. 
Not as impressive as some of the feats on this thread, but it blew my mind a little.

When he psyched out another dog. I had a foster greyhound, Roadie, and my grey, Catch. Roadie stole Catch’s favorite toy and was not about to share it. Catch went to the toy basket, grabbed a random toy, and started tossing it around and playing with it like it was the greatest toy on earth.

Then he paused for a moment and looked at Roadie (who was laying in the couch with the coveted toy). I suspect he was checking to see if Roadie was watching, which he was. 

He tossed around the toy more and threw it up into the air and caught it.

Check back to see if Roadie was watching. He was captivated. 

Tossed around the toy more, shook his head, chomped on it a few more times.

Roadie jumped off the couch and took the toy away from Catch. But it didn’t matter, you see, because Catch dove on to the couch and snagged back his favorite toy. 

He’s a smart boye.

I turned to go back to my chores and Ping let out a howl I didn’t think he was capable of and as I turned my son was seizing, full grand mal seizures that I recall clearly 11 years later.

I've returned more than once to have him greet me at the door. He waited until we were gone to get out. He's so used to being everywhere with me that I assume he took it upon himself to try and follow us haha

Went to pet Middy and came to realize his whiskers were all missing. Come to find every time Pepe grooms Middy, he bites his whiskers off in between licks. Revenge level: EXPERT. Meticulous planning, patience and strategic genius of a cat.

My border collie once managed to climb all the way to the top of the cupboard in my room without falling, not exactly smart but I still don't know how he did that

There was a dog I met named Bandit who lived out on some Ranchland to the north of my hometown. Bandit was a gray black mutt- kinda like a cattle dog or a heeler. 

Anyway, the winters here get pretty brutal, and Bandit would hunt for himself and the other ranch dogs, they would corner foxes, rabbits, all sorts.

One frosty morning the other dogs were whining and crying because they had no water- it had frozen over and they couldn't just stick their nose to the ice and drink. I followed one of the dogs round the side of the house and found their frozen bowls.

Bandit found some pieces of earth or rocks or whatever, and he figured how heavy they needed to be to break the surface ice so that he could drink. Sometimes he would even jump slightly onto his back legs so the rock would fall further.

He did that for 6 years following, I'm told.

That, imo is the smartest dog I had ever met.

When my dog feels like he isn't getting my full undivided attention, he will lock himself in the bathroom on purpose and start to cry/whine. He knows that I will go and open the door for him. Other than that he is a good pup.

Was dog sitting my friend's sheltie for a few weeks. We were on a walk and he noticed my shoe lace was untied. He stopped walking and barked at it. I tied my shoe and we kept going. He also poked me with his nose to let me know he wants something and then looks or walks to what he wants (like an empty water bowl). Very smart and aware of this surroundings.

My black lab rings a bell that we leave on the floor every time she wants to go outside or get a treat, she has  definitely abused the system to get loads of treats.

Whenever my puppy gets too much for my parents yorkie (who's still kinda my pet since I take care of her all the time,) the yorkie will look through the glass door to the yard and bark.  My puppy then assumes something's outside, demands to go out, and the Yorkie gets five minutes of peace.

I had a male cat which had the habit of hanging out in the bathroom with me when I used the toilet.

At the time I also had a habit of leaving the roll of toilet paper on the floor instead of on the holder...

Cut to some time in the past, I'm in the middle of a healthy bowel movement when in struts my cat.  

"Meow," he says as he stops dead in front of me then immediately proceeds to clean himself.

"Dude," I say to him, "I'm trying to poop, I don't wanna watch or listen to you licking your ass."

He stops, stands, turns his back to me, gives me a cat look over his shoulder and goes back to town like problem solved.

So I upped the ante.  I gave him 30 seconds to lull himself into a false sense of security... then "BOO!" as I reached down and touched his sides with my hands. 

Up he jumped, to the door he ran and at the threshold he sat.  I knew I had screwed up, I was getting another cat look which definitely told me I was in trouble.

I apologize, and he seems to accept it. He slowly approaches me while I'm still sitting there on the toilet, pants around my ankles, helpless as he counts to 30 lulling me into my own false sense of security...

Suddenly he strikes, but not at me, instead and without warning he grabs the roll of toilet paper sitting on the floor and in a single bound is back at the bathroom threshold. He gives me 2 seconds for my situation to sink in before he lies on his back, roll firmly grasped in his mouth and proceeds to use all four claws to shred my last roll of toilet paper into confetti.

He stands, drops what's left in his mouth on the floor, cat looks me one last time, turns and slowly walks off.

TL;DR I scared my cat, he revenge destroyed my toilet paper right in front of me.

My miniature schnauzer is supposed to pee on the right side of the house. For some reason, he prefers the left side. To correct this behaviour, we started giving him treats when he did his doodoo on the right side. He would get treats everyday. That is, until we noticed the right side was of a vibrant green while the left side was covered in brown stacks. We decided to spy on him. 
Turns out, he would walk to the right side, wait about a minute and sprint to the other side. Every. Day.
That same dog also just ate his vomit so I don't have to pick it up.

My cat Wally has impressed me a few times. 

If he gets sick and Im not home, he'll meow at me when I get home & lead me to it. 

If he is thirsty and I drink from water bottle, he'll climb up on me to try & drink from it. 

He will bring me toys to throw for him to play with. 

He will sit next to the water faucet & meow to tell me to turn it on. 

He will wake me up by pawing my mouth to tell me he is hungry. 

I love him.

About a month ago my roommates cat Waffles  started acting crazy one night. Kept meowing and perched herself on the entertainment center and just wouldn't stop meowing. We checked her food, etc, and couldn't figure out why. About an hour goes by and she won't stop, then I hear a very faint meow from afar. I finally realize that I can't find my cat Poofy. We search the whole house and I eventually find her locked in the garage! Waffles was trying to warn us and we had no idea!

My 4 year old cat is intelligent to an almost concerning level. 

As a kitten, she figured out how the door knob (lever) to our apartment worked, so if either of us left, she’d run, jump, and pull the lever down. Luckily, she couldn’t pull the door in. She will open doors in our current house, though, since she’s now tall enough to reach and turn the knob while standing on her hind legs. 

She also too easily figured out how the treat dispensing egg toys work: she batted at one once, ate the treat, then rolled on her back while holding it in both paws and shook the rest of the treats directly into her mouth until they were gone. She will also grab individual treats or bits of kibble in her paw and put them in her mouth instead of lowering her face to the food (though she doesn’t do this with wet food). 

She understands how the window locks in the house work. In particular, we have a shelf for the cats to sit on in one of the windows in our bedroom. She can partially lift the cordless blinds to look out. She knows which way the lock points for locked, and has managed to halfway unlock it before. If it’s unlocked, she just paws at the window as if she’s pushing it open. Luckily it’s too heavy for her. She also hisses at us if we lock the already closed window when she wanted us to open it instead. 

The last example I can think of right now is she knows where the vet is. We often take the cats in the car to different places, or occasionally just for a ride in the car since they like watching out the window (from their carriers, of course). She’s always fine until she sees the sign for the vet. She remembers what it looks like, and gets visibly upset staring at the sign when we turn into the parking lot. She doesn’t get upset when we pull into any other parking lot or driveway. 

She’s an awesome cat, and is very loving to her family. She can be a spoiled princess, especially to everyone else, but I love her so much. Our other cat is really dumb, so it’s a fun dynamic.

The night we had to put my golden retriever down, we had taken him to the emergency vet for severely declining during the evening. Before he was to undergo emergency surgery, the vet walked him out to say goodbye just in case something were to happen during the procedure. It was around 4am and my whole family was in the waiting room bleary-eyed from crying. 

We were sitting in a semi-circle when he walked out and he took his time laying his head in each of our laps, one by one, not missing a beat. He stayed in each lap for about 3 minutes, let us hug and kiss him goodbye, and then moved on to the next family member, 5 in total. Then, the vet walked him back and he didn't come back. 

I believe this was him understanding it was his time to go. My whole family agrees, we have never been more touched by the intelligence of him, just hours before his death. It ended up being cancer and he was only 9. 

I miss you, Dusty.

I have a cat who isn't very touchy-feely, doesn't show a ton of affection, etc. A friend of mine who has epilepsy was staying at my house and had an episode while no one was around. According to her, when she regained conciousness, my cat was licking her and giving her affection the rest of the day, as if he knew something was wrong. Something similar happened while I was crying once, my cat looked at me inquisitively and approached me, making that trilling sound that cats do when they're greeting you, and rubbed against me.

This is a story of revenge. I had a bromance going on with our English Bulldog, Rosco. Every once in awhile he would need to be put in his place though. One such occasion, he was getting rough with the family cat. When I tried to break it up, Rosco got lippy with me. Ok, so in the kennel he went to settle down and think about what he did. After he was done huffing and puffing, I let him out. He immediately ran back to my room. I didn’t think anything of it because he would spend a lot of time in there with me anyway. I figured he was just going back to get away from everyone and be in a safe space. Fast forward a couple of hours, it’s time for bed. I head to my room, Rosco isn’t in there, nothing unusual. I climb into my unmade bed and get settled in. I curl my toes around something soft and squishy. Genuinely not knowing what the hell it was, I flip on the bedside lamp and throw back the covers. In between every single one of my toes is creamy dog poop. I look toward the door, pretty pissed that the dog has defecated in the bed, and Rosco is standing in the door way. He gives me one of those bulldog snorts and trots off. I’m convinced he revenge pooped under the sheets after I had kenneled him for messing with the cat.

My ragdoll is ridiculously clever. He is 12 now so his brilliance is fleeting but every once in a while he still surprises me. When I first adopted him, I lived alone in a small apartment. I was all excited to have a pal so I kept buying him all kinds of fancy treats, only to come home and find them gone. (I tried high cupboards, tupperware, hiding them behind things.. didn't really matter so I just gave up trying to deter him)

For a while, I put them in the middle of a set of three heavy drawers and would come home to the package devoured and no evidence of the drawers being moved. For science, I kept planting treats to see if I could catch him in the act. Sure enough, one day I come home and notice the bottom of the 3 drawers is ajar. I slowly open the middle drawer and it all makes sense. He has been opening the bottom drawer, crawling up through the back, eating the treats and closing the bottom drawer behind him to destroy the evidence. 

I also have auto immune diseases and this same cat has slept beside me completely devoted for sometimes days at a time and has thrown a fit to alert my husband where I am when I was so sick I couldn't move/needed to go to the hospital, ect. He's a great kitty.

When my dog was still a puppy, she would always dig through the trash in the bathroom to chew on toilet paper. One day, my dad got us a motion sensed trash can that opened when you waved you hand over it and closed automatically. One day I come in to see my pug move her head over the trash bin and start taking out toilet paper... needless to say this dog is too smart for all of us.

Ellie (a cat) will run to check on me or my fiance if we ever make a surprised, frightened or scared noise. She's very protective of us and I honestly think if someone broke into our house she'd attack them. She also comes when called and she'll tap on the top of her treat container when she wants one. Not always, but most of the time if I'm sitting on the couch  and if I say "sit on my lap???" She'll jump up and sit on me.

To preface: this cat is a fucking idiot. I genuinely believe there's something wrong with him because he's so dumb. But he has his moments.

So, Loki has learned how to knock. Just very specifically on the bathroom door, and he only does it when I'm in there. If he hears me go to the bathroom without him, he'll sit there and "tap tap tap. tap tap tap tap" until I let him in.

He's also learned to turn on the touch activated cat toy, and even knows how many taps he needs to use to put it on his favorite speed and how many to turn it off.

May not be as special since I hear of other animals doing it, but he knows when something's wrong with me and makes damn sure to let me know.

Earlier this year, I had an ovarian cyst start to rupture. It was bleeding out into my belly, and by the time I had surgery to remove it, my ovary had no blood flow and was starting to die. I dealt with it for almost 3 days because the ER docs were like "lmao I touched your belly and couldn't find anything so here's some pain meds". 

The day after it ruptured, boyfriend and I came home from work and I wasn't feeling too hot. Loki was immediately all over me, and when we shut him out of the room, he freaked out and meowed like we'd never heard him do before. The moment we let him in, her was back all over me. Same thing happened the next night before I went to the ER the first time. When they didn't do much, I went back the next day and asked for a CT and an ultrasound. Three ultrasounds later, I was admitted for the ruptured cyst and dying ovary. Had the surgery the next morning, was home by that night.

When I got home, Loki was fine. Curled up at my side and went to sleep. No more panicking, no more terrifying meows. My baby knew something was wrong, and made sure to let me know. Sweet boy is currently curled up against my side. I love him. He's perfect.

We never close the gate and she never leaves the yard. We didn’t train her to do that, she just stays. Even when people walk by.

My yellow lab can open cabinets, drawers, etc. despite the child locks we put on them to keep her out. She would take things like the TV remote, kitchen utensils, your phone, things like that. She knows that if she chews them up and destroys them, she gets in trouble. So instead, she will go get a spatula (for instance), come into the living room to show you she has something you don't want her to have, and then runs off hoping you'll chase after her.

Before I moved out, my family dog would follow my mom to bed, wait for her to fall asleep, and then sneak to my room and sleep with me through the night. Then, early in the morning, would sneak back into my parent's room and pretend he had slept there the whole night. Took me several months to convince my mom he was cheating on her. Lol.

Our dog escaped the yard one morning and came back an hour later carrying a loaf of bread in his mouth.

I used to have an aquarium in my office. I've also got two cats. I'd close the office door when I left in the morning for work. Occasionally I would lock one cat in the office for the day.

One day this happened. When I got home, I couldn't hear the cat, and she didn't come greet me as usual. I opened the office door and she ran out meowing up a storm. I figured I would find a pile of cat shit somewhere, but the cat proved she's far too smart. She dragged a bag of aquarium gravel off the stand, and out about 4 feet. She then proceeded to shred the top off the bag, and used it as a litter box. I couldn't be mad, I was impressed.

She got lots of treats that night.

We had 2 cats, snickers and tiger. They did not like each other. It was much a "I tolerate you" attitude from snickers to tiger. One day snickers was walking around us crying. He was a pretty quiet cat so this was unusual and annoying. So I, being a young kid, thought chasing him would make him shut up. He bolts for the basement and I follow him and soon he jumps up on a file cabinet that is right underneath a small window. I look up and there is tiger, on the other side of the window. He managed to sneak out and didn't know how to get back in. It was a cold Feb night in Michigan so he was huddled by the window I think for warmth. Anyway as soon as I saw that I raced outside to get him. I was pretty surprised snickers cared at all to tell us tiger was outside but it was very clear he was taking me there despite my unorthodox way of getting there

We feed one of our dogs in the bathroom due to her being a little food aggressive. When we traveled to our family’s house for thanksgiving, we were getting their food out and she immediately ran to the bathroom there so that she would get fed.

We had a husky growing up when I was much younger. She was a master escape artist. Without fail we would come home to find her sleeping on the front steps waiting for us.

I'm sure this is getting posted way too late to get any attention, but several years ago when the Twilight movies were still a thing, my wife had a friend who was completely geeking out over them.  She insisted  that if we all just watched the movies we would see how awesome they were and stop making fun of her about it.  We eventually relented and her husband and decided to make a drinking game out of and we take a drink everytime one of the actors stared dramatically at the camera.  About half way through the film, the husband and I were smashed, my wife was playing with her phone and it was pretty clear that none of us were coming around.  It was at this point, that my oldest dog got off the couch, sauntered over to the PlayStation and pressed the eject button with her nose.  The movie popped out and she tiredly walked back to the couch and laid back down.  This was the first and only time she showed any interest in the TV or game consoles.

My cat kept laying on my sore swollen leg after I got home from giving birth. Turns out, I had developed a fairly large DVT behind my knee that extended into the thigh and calf. The Drs didn’t even think anything was wrong until my ultrasound came back.

My brothers fat indoor cat got outside and stuck up in a tree higher then we could climb and he didn’t know how to get her down. After a few minutes, I brought my cat outside and told him to go get her down. He scaled the tree and led her down one bough at a time, looking back at her and meowing to have her follow him. Hands down, the BEST cat any of my friends or family had ever known.

We had an Acura MDX and when we took our dog Lucy to the park we let her just chill in the back with the seats down and when the seats were down the seatbelts were still there just kind of sitting. So our dog would get in and then see us put on our seatbelt and so she would get behind the seatbelt and tuck herself in. Even though it didn’t help at all because it wasn’t clicked in it was still cute as all hell. Oh and she looked both ways before crossing because she saw us do it. We miss you Lucy, hope doggy heaven is treating you well <3

My little springer spaniel, Ellie about 5 months old learned how to open all the doors in the house. It wasn't long before she figured out where the food was. My dad thought I was over feeding her because she was gaining a significant amount of weight compared to the other dog. One night I caught her opening my bedroom door and then walking into the kitchen, then into the pantry. When I walked from behind half of her body was in the bag of dog food.

One of our cats is nicknamed The Mechanical Engineer because we had to install childproof locks on the cabinet doors. She's figured out how to open desk drawers and dresser drawers when she wants to get something, and lately has begun attempting to cover her tracks by closing drawers once she's done. There's still a pile of stuff on the floor so it's pretty obvious, but it's cute.

Usually whatever she was really looking to take ends up in her food bowl. She steals hair elastics a lot. So I've hidden hair elastics away in strange places such as on top of the shower stall. Ten minutes later there's a thud and a little cat is carrying a hair elastic through the hallway to the kitchen.

Sometimes when she's stolen a small shiny item she hides it in her mouth until she thinks we can't see her, then lets go of it to play. There's an amethyst ring I haven't seen in a few months. It may turn up behind a sofa years from now.

She even understands how the lock on her cat carrier works and she's tried to free herself when we've taken her to the vet. Fortunately she isn't strong enough to operate that mechanism but she's spent several minutes trying to push it, and you can tell from how she's angled her paws that she knows which way it opens.

One if my dogs, Touya, gets very excited when she has a toy in her mouth. She'll bring it to you and, without fail, run away when you try to take it, her entire body wriggling from tall wagging. She's very small and wily, so she's always too quick for me to take them and throw them for her. 

One morning I started having a panic attack. Didn't want to wake my husband (he hadn't been getting much sleep), so went to sit on the stairs and cry. This dog is always overexcited when I'm sitting low enough for her to weasel her way into my lap for pets, but she calmly came up and snuggled my side to comfort me. Then, she gets up again, goes and gets a toy, and comes back (shimmying excitedly, as usual). This time, however, when I reached for our she actually let me take it from her. I think I was so stunned that I stopped freaking out and just started laughing.  She proceeded to do this with the rest of her toys for the next hour until my husband woke up.  Turned into one of the happiest mornings for me. 

I guess she must have thought, "you need these more than I do, human. Feel better please."

When I was 12 my dad had a heart attack, and a quadruple bypass. When he came home, his chest was wired shut and it reaaaallllyyy hurt to cough. They gave him a small pillow to clutch to his chest to relieve some of the pain. When he went to bed, the pain of coughing would wake him up. So my dog picked up on this and would shove his head into my dad's chest everyone he coughed in bed. It was nuts and it helped my father get through it. Very good dog.

My last dog was a Husky Black Lab mix - all dark coat, thick curly tail and white husky eyes - she was gorgeous. Everybody has a "my dog is/was the  best dog ever story" and I love that about dogs. Well, our dog really was the best dog ever. We lived on a fish hatchery and she was one  radiant, happy af doggo. 
As she got older she mostly just slowed down, not too many health issues thankfully. When she was 13, I was out of town for work for about 2 weeks. I would Skype my kids and Bear every day or so (of course the kids named her bear:) while I was away. One Sunday, Father's day Sunday in fact, we all had a lenghty, fun Skype session. The kids told me about my dad surprise visiting them earlier in the week. My mom stopping by the day before for ice cream and the dinner they just had with all of Mom's family that afternoon. Bear hung out during the entire Skype session. She often would get weirded out, howl a bit - her way of saying hello -and then go find something else to do.
We ended the Skype call and I got another, heavier call about 3 hours later. Bear went into the back yard after the Skype session, laid down under our tree and didn't get back up. Just like that, she passed. 
I found out years later that snow dogs will often walk out into the ice and just die when they are old and no longer see that they are needed in the pack. Bear literally waited until she could say goodbye to every single person in the family, and then chose to exit peacefully. Next level intelligence

We have a German Shepherd, and he is simply the greatest dog we've ever owned to date. My husband served in the Marines for 13 years. As you can imagine, 13 years in the military takes quite a hefty physical toll on the body. His back is in constant pain, and his knees are terrible. Without any training whatsoever, our German Shepherd taught himself to help my husband up the stairs. He allows my husband to grab onto his collar, and will go slowly, one stair at a time, making sure my husband maintains balance, and will even brace himself against my husband to ensure he stays upright.  Each and every time my husband goes to the stairs our dog will run right over to his side, and will wait for him to grab his collar. 

Genius animal, and such a cherished member of our family.

I have rly bad ptsd and my cat knows when I’m about to have a panic attack. Like sometimes I get into this weird dissociative space before and I’m not really freaking out yet and she can be in the other room sleeping and she will come into where I am and start pawing at me and start demanding all of my attention and it will usually help pull me out of it. She wasn’t always so great with that stuff but she got better with picking up on my moods as she got older. I wish she was good in public spaces but she’s afraid of the wind so that rules her out as an emotional support cat 😂

I used to have a Samoyed.

When she was a puppy she was allowed on the couch. Later we came up with a rule saying she was no longer on the couch. I was mowing the lawn one day and looked inside and saw she was sitting on the couch. A few minutes later, I went inside the house and saw that she was no longer on the couch.

At some point, whenever my mother got groceries she would also buy a doggie treat. She would tell her "I got you something!" and she would excitedly eat the treat. It didn't take her long to figure out "groceries = treat" so she would excitedly expect a treat whenever somebody came in with groceries.

So whenever either of us was in the shower or bath he'd let himself in and keep watch. If it was a bath, he'd sniff you every so often to make sure you were okay.

He could also use the faucets and would lock the cats in the closet.

When my dog peed on the floor, I was passed at him (naturally) and punished him. He then came up to me with droopy ears looking down with something in his mouth. He drops it down and it turns out it's some of his meat from his lunch, and he just looked at me with those puppy eyes and I couldn't resist hugging him. He was happy right after that 👍

My cat does a lot of small things that make me think she’s actually very intelligent. She plays fetch. But will also play with herself. She’ll pick her toy up and throw it and run to catch it. Or hide it behind a curtain, go to the other end of the room and sneak up and “attack” it. There have been multiple times where I’ll get home from work and once she sees me she’ll grab a litter bag and bring it to her box to let me know to scoop it. I always scoop it once a day, she’s just reminding me haha. She knows that the ropes on the curtain raise it up, so if she wants to see out the window, she’ll pull on the curtains to try and lift hem up. I’m sure there’s more but those are a few I can think of off the top of my head.

My cat yawned, so I stuck a finger in his mouth. He sort of stared at my curiously as he shut his mouth, but didn't bite down hard. A few minutes later, he's sitting on my chest and I yawn. He proceeds to put his whole paw in my mouth.

When was I was young my family moved a long distance with two pets, a cat and a dog.  My mom said that cats can try to run off to find home after a move so we had a cat collar with a long leash to hold her while we were unloading the trailers.  I heard my Australian Shepherd bark twice on the back porch.  Abby NEVER barked unless something was serious.  I ran back there and my cat had run around a chair many times and then jumped off the chair with not enough room on leash to be on ground and was hanging there choking.  When I rounded the corner Abby was trying to chew through the leash.  Best dog ever. Both cat and dog lived long happy lives. RIP Abby and Reinette.

My dog is super sneaky. He's not allowed on the furniture, and never ever tries to get up on the couch or bed unless we invite him. One day I was taking a shower and had forgotten a body wash I had just purchased, so I left the shower running and ran out to my room to grab it really fast. I found him on the couch happily rolling around on his back. As soon as he realized I was there he froze for a moment, jumped off the couch and ran to his bed. That's when I realized the little jerk waits for me to get in the shower to get on the furniture and knows to listen for me to turn the shower off so he knows when to stop!

While I was out, my dog pulled a piece of paper out of the trash and pooped on it so that he wouldn't poop on the floor.

My dogs, Arrow and Beau ran off into the woods one day when I wasn't paying attention. Arrow had a leash on.  Beau came back alone hours later. 
I asked "Beau, where is Arrow? where is he?  He led me through the woods to the edge of someone else's property and started screwing around, so I figured, "ah, too much to expect from him"

I went back home.  Another hour or so passed, I was getting pretty worried, I tried asking Beau again.  Again, he led me through the woods, same path he took before, this time I followed him onto the stranger's land, went over a hill top and there was Arrow, his leash wrapped around a young pine tree and he was sitting in the sun, panting. 

Arrow could have literally died from heat stroke stuck out in the sun.  Beau understood what I asked, I didn't believe him the first time. He led me back  a second time. and helped me find Arrow.

Early in the morning, I open our sliding glass door to let my dog out. She stands there staring at me as I tell her to go to the bathroom and motion outside. After a 10 second staring contest I attempt to lead her outside by first going out myself. I then proceed to walk into the sliding screen door I failed to open and knock it off the rails. That was when I knew my dog was smarter than me.

We've got two dogs. One of the dogs has frequent seizures, the medicine only helps so much. 

The other dog can sense them before they'll happen. She'll warn us like 10-30 sec before we'll even notice. I know there are dogs trained to do this with humans but the other dog isn't trained whatsoever.

Not my current dog, but the family dog we got when I was a teenager.  I came home and went to my room and she's just barking for no reason.  Not furiously, but an unfamiliar cadence and enough to be annoying.  I finally come out of my room to see what she wants.  I look out the window and see my car trunk lid hadn't latched all the way and was wide open.  Not that I had much of value in there, but as a broke college student in a neighborhood where anything not nailed down gets stolen,  I thought it was pretty awesome of her.  She got extra treats and pets that day.  RIP Cleo.

We used to have a cockatoo, as well as some cats and dogs.

We were teaching the dogs some tricks, and the cockatoo was just doing his bird thing. Every day, the same routine: get some treats, call the dogs, sit, stay, lay down, roll over, get a treat, etc.

One night we were watching TV and hear the cockatoo call the dog by name.
"Sit. Stay. Lay down. Roll over. Good Boy". We heard something hit the floor, and then he called out the next dog's name.

Walked into the kitchen to find the cockatoo in the spot we always stand, giving orders to the dogs (who were obeying!), and then pulling treats out of the cup and dropping them on the floor. This went on for some time.

Dogs now liked the cockatoo, and would let him ride on their backs. Cockatoo would call them, tell them to lay down, would climb on, and ride around like a king.

The dogs knew what's up, would walk to the kitchen, and stand by the counter. Cockatoo would hop up and drop them a treat, say "good boy", and hop back on.

Funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

I had left my dog home alone for about an hour. It was the middle of winter and my family were very poor and didn't have oil or very good insulation in some parts of the house. So I got back and I found my dog with every single blanket in the house on my bed and he was in the very center of all of them.

Our cat hears the mailman delivering the mail through the letter slot in the door. He races to it, grabs each piece in his teeth, and then drags them - one by one - to the chair where I'm sitting.

If a piece of mail is too heavy for him to move, he just sits at my feet, MEOWING, looking back and forth between the letter slot and me.

My dog Roger will start barking at the front door as if someone is there. My other dog Flash will immediately join him. There is no one at the front door, Roger just wanted to take Flash's spot on the bed and all the pets.

There are two dog-parks near my home and my dog preferred one over the other, but the preferred one is a bit further away.

One day I was walking her and when she realised I was taking her to the closer one, she suddenly started to limp. I stopped to check her paws.  Finding nothing wrong, I continued, and the limp miraculously disappeared  once I started heading the way she wanted to go.

We had pot belly pigs when we were little because my brother and I were allergic to cats and dogs. Smart little fuckers. My brother and I would always yell "MOM! MOM!", so one day my mom left for a couple days and the pigs got upset. One of them started squealing and then opening it's mouth so it sounded like "MMMMMAMAMA". Then the other one started doing it. So we had two pigs in the house screaming for mama. It was creepy as fuck.

I live in the country.  Someone dumped a dog on me.  She is a tiny little long legged thing.   Anyway, my wife and I went through all the steps to make sure she wasn't just lost.  Facebook, vets and animal shelters etc.  No one ever claimed her so she lives here.  (2 years now)

About 6 weeks after she arrived we bought a camper.  A small walk in trailer rig.   We were loading up for the first trip and the little dog was suddenly no where to be found.  My wife found her hiding in a box of supplies in the camper.  Somehow that dog knew we were leaving for a while and was trying not to get left behind.
NEXT
I snuck downstairs and watched my small dog delicately push the chairs and a couple cardboard boxes around into an specific orientation, then wildly parkour across the objects in order to get to my dinner sitting on the table. He also carefully moved the fork out of the way using his claws so that it wouldn't make any noise. I notified him of my presence right before he started eating and he just froze and then looked really guilty. In addition, when I have a panic attack, my dog will sometimes bring me his favorite stuffed animal because I assume he thinks it will comfort me like it comforts him.

My cat has figured out how to turn on my heated mattress pad.  Its just a little foot pedal near the headboard. With out fail I come home everyday to it cranked and her cuddled down near the foot of my bed, where the coils double.

In the winter I sometimes wake up hot as hell and realize she's turned it on while I was sleeping. 



EDIT: The mattress pad is plugged into a WeMo, so I can preheat my bed when I want to. My roommate also works from home so I'm not to worried about the cat catching the house on fire because someone is always there.

She saved my life. I was sleeping, and started going into a diabetic seizure. My SO at the time was a very heavy sleeper (her dog). She jumped on the bed, whining and barking until my SO woke up. Ambulance was called, life was saved.

Carries his bone to you and pushes it into your hand. Then he starts chewing the other end of it while you hold it. When you try to pull on the bone to maybe start a tug-of-war game with him, he stops chewing and gives you a look like, "What the heck? Just hold it. You're the one with opposable thumbs." 
NEXT
I had the best dog ever.  One night I was fast asleep and he was gently "biting" my hand just enough to wake me up.  Once I woke up he started tugging on it as if to say, follow me.  It was so weird.  SO I follow him and he leads me to the side door or my house, sits facing the door and barks ever so silently.  I then realize someone is outside picking the lock.  I called 911.  It was a drunk guy, no idea what his intentions were once he got in, but my dog for some reason managed to get him arrested.  He probably would have been scared away had my dog just barked, but for some reason the old boy wanted to alert me quietly.

I watched a chicken teach another chicken how to get out of the coop. 

My parents have chickens and my dad built their coop himself. For the first six months or so they found new ways to escape into the yard until my dad sealed up all the escape routes. 

Tipsy, the boss chicken, was hanging out in the corner of the coop, and once she saw that two of the three other chickens were in the house, she rustled her feathers to get the third chicken, Digsy, to look at her. Then she hopped up onto a branch and wiggled through s gap in the wire. 

Then, she got back INTO the coop and looked at Digsy with that little side eye thing chickens do until Digsy tried it herself, then followed her out into the yard. I let them have that one, and until dad patched the hole a week later I only saw Tipsy and Digsy out in the yard, not the other two. 
NEXT
My chickens held a funeral.

In our flock of maybe ten bantams, there was one elderly, respected hen. Even the brash rooster, who would spend most of his time chasing other chickens away from 'his' feed, meekly made space for Grey Girl when she slowly made her way over to the chicken feed. She was mother and grandmother to many of them, and you could tell how much they esteemed her.

One morning, I open the chicken coop as usual, but not a chook was to be seen. Normally they'd be all running out to find the night's bounty of bugs, but not this morning. I walk inside the pen to see what's up.

There is a circle of chickens. An actual circle, with Grey Girl's body right in the middle. All the chooks are making this weird wailing sound, which I had never heard before. I am in no doubt they were mourning the passing of their elder mother.

What's more, the body was lying outside the shed where she would have been roosting. There is a good chance that she was actually pulled out of the claustrophobic, poo-filled shed and placed in the open space by the chickens, so they could pay their respects.

After about half an hour the chooks all wandered off and I buried the body. And I never saw that behaviour again.

Edit: I still eat chicken

I have a African grey so he probably doesn't count, but when he wants to be can be a vindictive little shit.

When I was first taking him home (he was originally my mom's) I was also driving my sister home, she had just had jaw surgery so she was on meds that gave her motion sickness. So I get the bird in his travel cage and wrap it in a towel, then get my sister in, and both of them are being irritable little shits so about ten minutes into the drive my sister reaches back and smacks the side of his travel cage to shut him up.

About and hour later, sister gets sick. I pull over, she darts out of the car, Jojo fucking starts laughing. His cage is still wrapped so the first time I assume it's just his response to us stopping because how could he know she's sick?

She got sick five times that drive and he laughed at her every time. With my mother's laugh.

He also used to have a habit of calling the dogs by name, mimicking the fire alarm to make them howl, howling with them to keep them going, then laughing at my mom when she came up the stairs to shut them up. (Now he mostly just sings to me and asks for cheese he's mellowed out a lot)
NEXT
One of my cats back when I was a kid, Thomas, got a urinary tract infection somehow. We would've never known because he's both an indoor and outdoor cat and usually went outside to relieve himself.

One day he jumped up into the bathroom sink, pushed the plunger down to stop the water leaving the basin, and pissed in it. Afterward he stood over it crying until someone came and saw the bloody urine in the bowl.  

He found a way to directly tell us "Yo, something's wrong with me."

He could also open doors on his own.

I used to have this 5-6 foot iguana and let it roam the house because it was badass.

It would chill in the bay window and catch sunlight all day. One day he climbed the back door and clawed his way out of the screen. 

I found him perched ontop of our garage, he changed his skin to almost pure black and was flared up as big as he could get trying to gather all the sun he could.

I guess he saw that garage everytime he was basking in the sun and decided one day he wanted to be on top of it.
NEXT
I have pet rats. One of them broke a tooth, and the infection spread to her brain (the teeth go all the way up above the brain). I had her on antibiotics, but she was a bit "tilted" to one side. When they were out on a table, I noticed her falling over near the edge of the table, and was afraid that she would fall.

However, before I have time to react and move, another of my rats walk up to her, takes a firm but careful grip around the base of her tail and pulls her away from the edge of the table.

Now, I know one should be careful in placing human thoughts in animal heads, but usually, a rat "biting" another rat's tail is a surefire way to start a fight, and I can't see any other reason to do it except that she saw ahead, noticed the potential problem, figured out what to do to solve it and implemented that solution.

She'll always be remembered my little hero rat.

That's not the only time I've seen rats do things that makes me go "WTF?!?! How did they figure that out?", but it's the most impressive event. I have both rats and a dog, and the rats are as smart as the dog, possibly smarter.

I had a pair of gold fish that grew to be quite large. Their names were nemo and toad. When nemo was dying toad did everything in his power to "revive" him. Including swimming alongside him and under him to boost him up and giving up larger potions of the food. After the nemo passed away toad got super depressed. He wouldn't eat at all and spent all day moving the little pebbles at the bottom of the fish tank from one side of the tank to the next. he died not long after

We lived in an apartment complex that didn't allow pets.  Unfortunately the people who frequently drove into the complex and dumped unwanted cats & dogs weren't aware that residents weren't allowed to have pets.  One evening, there was an orange tabby crying piteously in the yard behind our building just 25 yards from one of the busiest roads in our city.  The neighbor across the breezeway said that she saw him tossed out of a car that morning.  I was worried that he would get creamed on the road and spent two hours sitting in the grass next to him with a bowl of ground hamburger to earn his trust.  I had no idea what I was going to do with him after that, I just didn't want to see him starve or get run over.  

After a few weeks we worked out a living arrangement - he stayed in the apartment during the day with food and water and a bed and then went outside at night.  We had to keep his presence hidden so that the apartment management wouldn't fine us or evict us.  We couldn't keep cat food bowls outside or a litter box inside (the staff collected garbage, so they'd know if I was dumping used cat litter).  Due to his effervescent personality we started calling him Jonsey, the Shithead (Aliens reference). We were working on a solution house him permanently, but it was going to be a few more months before we could either get him into a rescue or move to a new residence that allowed pets. 

One night, during a round of terrible thunderstorms and heavy rain Jonsey was less than thrilled to head outside and we weren't hot on the idea either.  So he curled up in the corner of the couch and we headed to bed.  The following morning I woke up and stumbled for the coffee maker.  My husband asked me if the reason I was so tired was because I was up late cleaning up after the cat.  I had no idea what he was talking about. He told me to look in the kitchen sink.  There was a dishrag lying in the bottom of the sink and when I moved it there was cat poop in the drain.  It took me few seconds to figure out what I was looking at and what it meant.  To my husband it looked as if I had cleaned up cat poop and, in disgust had just thrown it in the sink to deal with it in the morning.  What had actually happened was that Jonsey needed to use the bathroom and, instead of using any of my many houseplants, the corner, or  just about anywhere else,  he had chosen  the absolute best alternative to a litter box available to him - the empty kitchen sink.  He'd done his business and courteously covered it over with the dishtowel I always kept draped over the neck of the faucet.  He earned a forever home with us and we moved to a house a few months after that.    
NEXT
I had a cat, a good friend, a long long time ago whom I still miss.  He was a big tabby with awesome tan/orange stripes.  I would climb up to the roof sometimes to avoid my housemates and relax and stare at the moon.  One night I climbed up there, and he was up there.  He saw me and seemed to get very happily excited to see me.  He ran to one edge of the roof, looked down, then looked at me.  Then, he ran to another edge, looked down, looked at me.  He did that at every edge.  I figured out what he was doing. At the last one, I said, "ok.  Thank you for showing me. Don't worry.  I won't go too far and fall off."  He looked very satisfied, walked to me, and laid on my chest, and we watched the moon together.  

Edit: Wow thanks for all the nice votes!  He was a good strong tabby.  Sadly, he was not strong enough to resist the siren song of the cat lady down the street who fattened him and 30 other cats as her babies she called them when I would go get him from her place.  When she moved, I never saw him again.
NEXT
I had a very smart and wonderful golden retriever, Emma.

She would sometimes try trading one of her gross rawhide chews for something we were holding if she wanted it--she once dropped her toy in my dad's lap, nudged it towards him, and started "speaking" (not like a bark, more like dog complaining) while nodding at the apple he held.

She would also distract our book smart but not street smart other golden if she wanted the toy the other dog had. She'd take a random toy, go up to one of us and make a big deal, jumping and barking and playing with us with the toy. Then when book smart dog dropped her toy and ran to see what all the fuss was about, Emma would immediately leave us and grab book smart's toy and run off with it.

One time she found a hurt dove and brought it to us in her mouth, holding it so gently. 

I miss her so much! Her favorite food was buttered bagels, and every Sunday when we got fresh bagels, she'd stand in the kitchen next to them and complain at us until we gave her some, with butter.
NEXT
My dog figured out how to open the refrigerator.  I guess she sticks her stupid head in the handle to get is started then paws it open.  She then proceeded to open the meat drawer (with her teeth, the evidence was all there) and remove all of the contents and eat it.  

She then puked a bunch of it up and had wicked diarrhea.  Nothing quite like coming home from a hard day of work and walking in on a war zone like I witnessed.  Plus I was looking forward to eating that bacon :(

My Shetland Sheepdog seems to be supernaturally cognizant of your feelings AND your level of attentiveness. Aside from trying to calm down highly emotional situations with worried barks or smothering you with affection, for example, this food fiend always knows how to fake you out and steal a meal. We know her game, but she knows how to capitalize on brief seconds when we're off guard. 

Two examples:


1. Without fail, when company comes over and there are appetizers laid out on the table, she will excitedly run to the door barking to greet them (as always) but as soon as she sees we're focused on the guests in the hall, she'll run back over to the food while throwing the sound of her bark toward us down the hall to give the impression that she is still around. Once at the doorway, she bolts to the table and steals what she can before we realize it.


2. One time when I was hanging out eating in front of the TV, my wife came home and started talking to me from the doorway. As I'm focused on her and the conversation, this sly creature sneaks in between my legs without being felt and stealthily snags the last bite of my sandwich from the coffee table, slithering out of sight to enjoy it without even brushing up against me (and it was a tight space). I didn't realize it until I found myself grabbing at an empty plate. You'd think my wife would've said something as she was in plain view of this, but the act was executed so smoothly that it barely registered in her brain.

We had a dog called Suki, probably the smartest dog we've ever had.  I had a kitten at the time, Sam, who was trying to climb into a box.  She managed to get her paws onto the edge and lost her footing,  hanging from her front paws.  Suki watches Sam awhile with interest.  Realising Sam was stuck, Suki casually walks over, puts her muzzle under Sam and flicks her head, flipping Sam to safety on top of the box. Rescue completed, she saunters away like she hadn't done anything extraordinary.

I once tried to put my roommate's dog in his kennel. Sweet dog--he obeyed me and went inside without a fuss, then looked at me like, "okay, now what?" I closed the door, put the latch down, and told him to stay in there like a good boy. He gave me this look that said "are you serious with this?" Without missing a beat, he calmly lifted the latch with his nose and walked out of the kennel.

So, I'll frequently ask my African Grey when she's feeling affectionate "You want skritches?"  So sometimes when she wants attention she'll just go "skritches?"  Of course, I'm not always in a position to do it, and sometimes she's just playing games and is preparing to ambush-bite me, so she doesn't always get them right away.

And one day I'm talking with my parents when she starts asking "Skritches?" But since we were in the middle of a discussion I didn't go to her right away.  After a few repetitions she pauses and then clearly, and with a little irritation, states firmly "*I* want skritches."

I'd never heard her update the pronoun like that and certainly never spoke that phrase exactly.  My conversation with my parents was absolutely stopped with our surprise.

And yes, she got her damn skritches.

I witnessed this with my uncle's dog. My uncle was lying on the couch and she was lying on his feet and legs. He let out a huge fart which was aimed directly at her face. She lifted her head and glared at him and he started laughing. She got up and walked away in disgust. A few minutes later she came back, jumped up on his chest, stuck her butt in his face and farted on him and walked away. I laughed so hard I cried and gave her so many treats.

I had an iguana that just died in January at the age of 22.

Ages ago he had hurt his tail and had to get part of it cut off. He had to take antibiotics for a while, which he hated.  First I hid them in the end of a banana, and he'd bit the end off.  But, he quit eating banana entirely to avoid the pill.  So I tried other foods.  Long story how we got to spaghettios, but I had the pill hidden in a little plate of spaghettios.  He examined them closely, and nudged them, then found the pill.  I was waiting to see if he's refuse it, but instead he gave me the most hateful glare.  Then he shoved a paw into the spaghettios and swiped very hard backwards, causing most of the spaghettios to spatter against the back of his cage.  Then he puffed up and shook his head at me and continued glaring to make sure I understood that hiding the pill in spaghettios was absolutely not acceptable.

My family's cat was so amazingly smart. She saved my life twice. 

1) when I was an infant, I was in my crib next to my parents bed. I somehow got twisted up and started suffocating in my blanket. This cat jumped on my mom's face until she woke up, then jumped into my crib. Had it not been for her, I would have died. 

2) when I was a stupid kid, I was eating warhead hard candies. Instead of eating them like a normal person, I was squeezing one end and shooting it into my mouth. Well, I squeezed too hard and it got lodged in my throat. I made it to the back door (my dad was in the garage) before I collapsed. My cat ran out, and started swatting at my dad and got him to follow her. That was scary. 

Man, I really miss that cat. She died a couple years ago at about 23 years old. 
NEXT
When I was going through a really bad spell with depression my dog used to come in to bedroom and check I was okay. He would lay his head down on the bed just standing watching me. He could also open every door in the house save for the front door, and one night he was out a walk with my dad off the lead in a field when my dad lost sight of him. He somehow made his was to my grandparents house. We think someone may have tried to steal him as he had managed to wriggle out of his collar.

I had a hamster that we kept in a fishtank, with a mesh wire ceiling.

He reorganized his cage so that the wheel was close to one of the walls, and he'd squeeze himself between the wall and the wheel and run up the wall. We thought it was hilarious.

Well, apparently it was practice.  One night he finally succeeded in his plan, which was to propel himaelf over the top of the wheel, catch his claws in the wire mesh, and chew a hole through the top, and escape.

We had a dog that liked to roam the neighborhood too much so we installed one of those wireless fences that give a shock from a collar when you cross it. The law requires it to beep and give a warning before the shock to train the dog to stop, which is good. But she figured out that if she got near it then it would start beeping. So she went to where the beeping started and laid down. Then just lay there until the beeping stopped and she knew the battery was drained and too weak to shock her so she would just walk across.

We have a family that owns a couple of African Grey parrots. When the kids were teenagers, the parents went out of town for the weekend, specifying there should be no parties whatsoever in their absence. Naturally the kids throw the party, and manage to clean up brilliantly. They almost got away with it until at dinner the night the parents returned, the Greys started making this whole new range of sounds including the sound of a beer pop tab opening, and the sounds of ping pong balls hitting plastic cups and the floor. Busted by birds.

We had one remarkably intelligent pet rat. There was a number of intelligent things he did, but here are some highlights.

His much larger older brother was keeping him away from one of the food dishes on the first level. He chews a hole in the bottom of a box on the top level and moves it down to the first level. He manages to move the box, with him inside it, and the hole he chewed perfectly aligned with the food dish. He camped his box right over the bowl, with him in it, blocking his brother out, where he could eat in peace.

He was the master of manipulating his environment. Inside their cage was a number of levels and boxes. He would push them around, nest them, or chew them to get wherever he wanted to go. It was like watching someone playing a video game where they had to arrange boxes to get where they wanted. It was all the more impressive given he had limited mobility from his rear legs, and more than compensated in this way.

We would put puzzles filled with treats in their cage to give them something to solve. Without fail he was always the one to solve them, no matter how many layers we would put on them.

He had a few tumors removed over the course of his life. Without fail he always seemed to remove his stitches a day or so before he was scheduled to go back in for removal. Provided he could reach them. Everyone else would either leave them be or immediately try to remove them.

No matter where you would put food blocks, he would carefully pick them up and place them in designated food bowls.

He was extremely vocal in the way some dogs, like huskies are. Unlike others he would modulate his squeaks to try and communicate.

RIP Felix, you brilliant little rat.

Cat peed in the toilet completely untrained.

Had a dog that faked a limp for attention. 

I guess she remembered being fawned over when she did get hurt once in the past, and was upset that a new puppy was getting all the love at that moment; so she walked into the room, assessed the situation, and starting limping around.
NEXT
I used to have a cat that would jump up and grab the refrigerator door handle and hang from it.  Then he would rock back and fourth until the door finally swung open.  He would then proceed to rummage through the food on the lower shelves and have himself some snackz.

At the lake with my half blue healer half black lab when I was a kid. We had water in a small plastic butter tub for her. To keep it from blowing away she put rocks in it. We were all amazed at the problem solving skills.

Every morning when I wake up, I step outside for a smoke and let my dog out to handle his business in the yard. He's usually done by the time I am.

One day, he was sniffing something really interesting and he was not ready to come back in yet. I forced him inside and he seemed pretty pissed about it. 

As soon as we walk through the door, he runs ahead of me around the corner and in to my bedroom. As soon as I get to my room, he's waiting for me. We lock eyes, he lifts his leg, and pisses all over the side of my bed while maintaining eye contact.
NEXT
It was storming - thunder, lightning, heavy rain. My dog was scared and refused to go outside before bed for his customary pee. That was annoying because he always wakes me up if he has  a sudden urge to pee... So it stormed all night long. I was up at 7 and getting into the shower when I noticed it was wet and sticky. He had peed in the shower to avoid going outside during the storm. He hasn't done that since, but it was impressive.

NEXT
I had a really large cat named Willy. For some reason he was just a huge muscular cat. I think my parents told me he was some rare sort of breed. When I was 9 or 10 my neighbors had this really scary black Labrador that they always had chained up in the back yard. One day I was riding my bike back home from my friend's house when that lab was in the front yard and chased me down. I tried to get away but that dog tore up my leg and ankle really bad. (Still have scars 14 years later.) I remember getting home and sitting on the steps with my parents trying to bandage me up and stop bleeding. Willy came over and looked at my leg then looked up and had this look like "Nobody hurts my humans!" 30+ pound Willy bolted out the door straight to the neighbors house like a enraged cat avenger! He flew straight at that huge black Labrador and clawed up his sorry dog butt. After that the dog never barked at me, never even got worked up when I rode by. Because that dog knew Willy was king. Every night till he passed Willy would sleep on my bed. And I slept soundly knowing nothing could hurt me as long as Willy was there. Think of that cat every day and what an amazing personality he had. I miss him so much!

My cat knows when I'm on the verge of having full blown panic attacks, and will jump on me to try and distract and/or comfort me. She knows me too well.

My little white dog stumbled and fell jumping off the couch.  Having noticed that my wife and i saw the whole thing she nonchalantly barrel rolled and started rubbing her back on the floor as if nothing had happened. Stopped and then stared back at us to confirm that she meant to do that...  i have by far the weirdest dog ever.

My cat understands the spacial relation of the interior and exterior of the house. If he wants to be let in, usually he will go to the porch, but if we don't hear him, he will go up to the living room window or the bedroom windows.

My old dog knew that our other dog had passed away. About a week after our dog died, she was barking like crazy and was yanking her chain. One day she got out before we could chain her up, and ran right to where our dog was buried, patting the ground with her paw as if she was respecting the grave. After a while she then silently went back into the house.
NEXT
Once my cat had fleas, and she was utterly miserable. She avoided the carpets of course because she knew they lived there, and walked only on couch tops and hardwood floors. She is very attached to me, and requires a lot of attention. During this time, I couldn't give her the adequate attention she requires, since we were struggling to contain the infestation. She was sitting on a couch placed over a rug, and staring at me with this exhausted expression. I looked at her and said "If you're trying to avoid them, you'll have better luck over there" and pointed to a comfortable spot which was likely flea free. She looked over to the spot I pointed toward, then back at me, then got up and moved accordingly. I find it strange how eerily well my cat understands me sometimes. I talk to her like a regular person.
NEXT
My friend's pet.  
  
I was sitting on the couch with a buddy while said friend was making some food, and while we were talking, her dog started to eat food from its bowl.  
  
When he got out of food, he tried to press the button that opens the lid of the device, that releases more food to the bowl. He didn't make it. I started laughing and said "What a stupid dog...". The dog imediately stopped and stared at me. I stopped laughing. The dog kept staring, pissed. After solid 10 seconds, the dog walked away on the opposite direction. After a few steps, the dog stopped, turned his head and stared at me for 5 more seconds. Then left.  
  
I got scared.

I store the catfood in a container similar to

My cats think that anytime I'm in the kitchen, they should be fed, regardless of how long it has been since they last ate.

We had this awesome pet bunny that used to follow us everywhere. She would follow us into the kitchen because she loved food! Every time she heard the fridge door open she would run to the fridge for any snacks. My dad ate popcorn every night and she would climb on his lap and eat popcorn. 

Do not allow your bunny to eat house food it doesn't end well :( 
NEXT
My backyard has a wooden gate with a latch that opens when you push down from the inside or pull up from the outside. My chocolate lab somehow figured out that she could jump up and push down on the latch with her paw, and for the longest time my family was so confused as to how she kept getting out of the yard whenever we left her in the yard to do her business for too long.

I have a Golden Retriever, when he was a puppy he was very sneaky. He also has an obsession with taking my shoes, and he still does btw, so any chance he got to take my shoes he would. When he was smaller he would chew them so I never wanted him taking my shoes. 

But one day, I was making a sandwich before work. I had just enough time to make it and then eat it before I had to leave. He sat and watched me make that sandwich quietly without a fuss. And for a 6 month old golden retriever puppy, I could only be suspicious. He watched as I toasted the bread, layed down the ham and the cheese, top it with pickles and lettuce and tomato. It was going to be a great sandwich, I even put some chips on the side of the plate. I sat down at the table, and took a bite and then I realized my dog disappeared. 

I quickly thought, he's in my room upstairs and he's probably destroying my shoe. So I quickly ran to the stairs and there he was right at the top with my shoe in his mouth. I told him to drop it and he began to trot out of sight. So I chased him up the stairs and into my mother's room where he dropped it almost immediately. He then ran away and down the stairs so I put my shoe away, and then I realized I left my sandwich unattended. I race down the stairs and there he was... Standing in the hall way to he kitchen hunched over, devouring  my sandwich. He ate the entire thing in like three bites. It was gone before I could even do anything about it. I picked up what remained, one piece of lettuce, and as I did he licked me in the face. All I could smell was ham and I felt like at that point he was taunting me. I didn't have any more ham to make another sandwich, or the time to make anything else because I had to be in work. That's  probably one of the smartest things I've ever seen him do. God damn you, Otis.

When I was younger I had an African Gray Congo parrot. He was so smart beyond knowing names of the family members. Once I was crying about something (like a normal 8 does) and he asks me "What's wrong, pretty girl?" (He called me pretty girl as a nickname). I told him and he started singing to cheer me up. The fact he knew I was upset, asked, and knew how to cheer me up just amazes me.

We had a fraternity house cat (that now lives with me in my apartment) that one night kept meowing frantically and motioning for me to follow him, which he did all through our house until he led me to one of the younger guys laying on his back choking on his vomit passed out.

Growing up I had 2 female cats. Dizzy the oldest didn't like Chloe, the smaller one who had toxoplasmosis (I think) and walked like she was marching all the time. It was awkward and not at all graceful, but pretty funny. (Don't worry, she had a very long, happy life.) 

Anyhow, I wouldn't believe this if I didn't see it for myself - but Dizzy would see Chloe coming down the hallway, hide behind a corner, and just as she was coming into view, Dizzy would stick her front leg out to trip her. Wouldn't hurt her or anything, she just loved to watch her trip and fall. I loved Dizzy, but she was such a cunning asshole.

My cat climbed up a cedar tree, which was fucking tall, like a hundred and fifty feet or so, and he was about 70 feet up. He was an inside cat, and had escaped. I spent a couple days trying to find him, and the only way I noticed that he was in the tree was when he started meowing at me when I'd walk by. I tried everything I could think of to coax him down, as I didn't have a ladder big enough to even reach the bottom branches of the tree. I had to borrow a ladder from a neighbor to get to those branches, and climb up the tree to the cat to even see what the predicament was due to the thickness of the leaves. I hate heights, but I made it up. And there sat Figaro, meowing at me, not knowing what to do. I'm sure he was starving and thirsty, and probably scared and desperate. I couldn't just grab him, though, as I needed both hands to avoid falling to my death. So what I did was find a lower branch that seemed like he could safely reach, and pat the branch. I didn't know if he'd be able to interpret my signal, but he did, and he moved to that branch. I found the next branch down, patted it, and he moved to it, scared and jittery, but he kept looking at me, waiting for me to tell him where to go. We did this all the way down to the bottom branches. I was able to hold him down the ladder. I felt like we were communicating then. A few days later, my gf broke up with me and took Figaro with her.
NEXT
My cat figured out how to make files on my mac.  For a awhile i would find files named "nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmmmjjjjjjjjj".  I thought it was because she would walk across the key board until i saw her in the middle of the night standing on the keyboard and then watching the screen.    Then she would adjust her feet and watch the screen again.  She knew the keyboard determined what went on with the screen and experimented with it.  But after awhile she got bored with it.


Also when she was a street cat( how we met); i lost a glove one night walking home from the subway.  I went back to look for it and saw her in her usual spot.  She perked up when she saw me and went out of sight and came back again, putting my glove down in front of her and adopting her best"look what I did" pose.


She doesn't fall for box traps.


Knows the laser dot cannot be caught.  But she likes to watch it anyways. 


She gave me and my Xgf a headless mouse on Valentines Day.  Left it in the doorway to our bedroom!


And when she was a street cat she would walk with me along her block by the subway.  I lived around the corner and a few blocks down.  She got very sick at one point and came and found my building and sat outside of it.   I then told my roommates to go fuck themselves and that i was adopting her.  Took her to the vet and spent a few months getting her healthy again.  


That was 9 years ago next month.  I love the fucking fucks out of you Kitty!

We have three cats. The alpha is a short haired, domestic ginger. He's kind of a dick, but he takes care of the others. One evening he was meowing so loudly that it sounded like screaming. He was batting at the door to the garage. I opened it and one of our other cats ran inside (it was mid winter and about 20 degrees Fahrenheit in there). Pete (the ginger) then nonchalantly walked back to his spot on the pet bed and promptly went to sleep.

When I was a kid, our German shepherd heard us kids calling our mom "Mom" all the time and figured that must be her name, so she taught herself to say it and would address her as such.

When we would tell people this, they'd figure she was making a sound that sounded similar or something, but when they'd be around our dog and gear her say that, crystal clear, and obviously for the purpose of getting my mom's attention, they'd freak out.

I miss that dog.

His name was Shep. He was this mammoth of a sheep herder, although never used for herding. I was maybe 4 at the time, and I lived on a very busy commute road. I'm telling this story from my parents perspective, I was too young to remember.

One morning, I was playing outside with my family, and my parents got distracted talking to neighbors. I decided it was going to be a fantastic idea to run into the road. 

My parents didn't notice me bolting towards the road, but what they did notice was that Shep, who was originally probably half-asleep popped his head up, quickly analyzed what was happening, and took off like a bat out of hell in my direction, runs in front of me, and knocks me backwards just inches from rush hour traffic.

I am fully convinced that if Shep was not with our family at that time, I would not be here today.

After all these dog revenge pee stories I thought I'd share. I had the sweetest little mutt in the world...corgi legs and big German shepherd ears. I got him when I was in college and he went with me everywhere. 
One night almost everyone was out drinking except me, my friend, my old boyfriend, and his friend. While my friend and I watched a movie, my dog stood by the back door listening to the other two talk outside. I decided to playfully eavesdrop so I could jump outside with a well timed response to what they were saying when I realized the subject was me. More specifically, his friend used this time to try and convince my old boyfriend that being single was better.
My dog promptly walked away from the door for the first time all night, walked into my boyfriend's friend's bedroom and peed right in front of the bed. He never peed inside ever again after that. Let's just say I definitely rewarded that negative behavior.
NEXT
I'm late to the party but this one always amazed me. 

I had a cat when I was a kid, and certain times we would have to relegate him to the laundry room for short periods of time. He hated it, and made it his goal to escape. 

The handles on the doors weren't knobs, but the king you grab and turn. He learned how to jump and hang on to the door handle so the door would open. 

So the solution was to put a little hook on the bottom of the outside of the door, and have a little metal loop for the hook to fit into on the door frame. 

I would see his little paw reach under the door and start pawing at the hook until he knocked it out of the loop. Then he'd hang on the door and open it. I don't know how he knew how the hook even worked. It was on the outside of the door; he never saw it latch. But he knew it was blocking his exit and knew how to unlatch it.
NEXT
When I was a kid I had a rabbit called Lopsie. Because I didn't know any better back then, and because my parents weren't really animal people, he wasn't neutered. He used to get a bit amorous with my arms. Actually he used to be a bit amerous with many things, his relationship with his cuddly toy was always the talk of my parents' BBQs... He was a sexually frustrated bunny, but he was happy other than that. He had free range of my parents huge garden when I was home and a custom build larger-than-usual- rabbit hutch when I wasn't.

For some reason I decided I wanted to grow carrots in the garden with no forethought of protecting them from their natural predator, the bunny. I bought seeds and soon after they started to sprout. Of course this interested Lopsie immensely and he made it his mission to eat all the carrotlings. Now I knew he was a pretty smart rabbit because I'd taught him I didn't want him to eat the carrots and he knew. He did it anyway but he knew. I used to reach out and stop him every time he went near my little bit of garden.

His love affair with my arms continued. One sunny day after school I was lying on the grass and he was trying to get to my arms. I crossed them underneath my body to save them from bunny spunk. He tried to get them for a while, then he stopped, looked at me and headed off to the carrot patch. As a reflex I stretched my arm out to stop him and he turned and mounted my arm in one swift motion.

To this day I swear he went for the carrots because he knew I would bring my arm out if he did.

(Since then I have had many more rabbits, all have been neutered and had bunny friends.)

I'm way late to the game, but this deserves to be here. My dog saved my life. I was a young teenager battling severe depression from severe bullying and a non supportive family. My family downplays mental illness as "it's all in your head, get over it" and I spiraled into suicidal tendencies. One night I decided to go through with it and ate over 100 aleve (I stopped counting around 118). I go to bed, closing my door and fall asleep to what I think is the last time ever. After some time, my dog (around 2 years old) starts agressively scratching and barking at my door. She's never done this before ever, and it wakes me up. And I start vomiting black bile and pills. Non stop vomiting. I decide to tell my parents what I did and am rushed to the ER. The toxicology report showed only 18 in my system. They said I was extremely lucky I didn't take more, because it can become fatal at higher doses. I'm alive today, because my dog had sensed I was fading away. She slept in my bed every single night since. She passed last year and I'll miss her forever. That dog loves me with all her little heart, and I returned it unconditionally.

I had this awesome German Shepard named Madie. I was once ice skating on a "pond" (it was a very large puddle formed by a flood that then froze over), and she noticed something in the woods. To this day, I still do not know what was there. She herded me back home through the neighbor's yard, never taking her eye off that spot in the woods. 

She also basically trained the next 2 dogs we had (both Shepards too), and despite suffering a massive seizure when she was a year and a half old which miraculously she survived without any lasting damage she lived 13-14 years.

My conure is pretty intelligent... We've been working on "step up" training. I show him the treat, I say step up, and he normally steps up onto my finger. Except, most days, he will wait for me to get the treat he feels like he wants. I hold up a sunflower seed. No go. I hold up a piece of dried papaya... no go. I hold up the banana chip -- that's the one he wants so he jumps at the chance to step up. 

He knows how to "give a kiss" and give a little peck and kissy noise with his beak, and I swear he knows how to say "night, night" after i cover up his cage. 

I love this damn bird.

I had a bassit hound for a few months before we had to give him away, he had this extremely derpy and dumb personality. But he had this problem that he couldn't eat food out of his dish, so he would scoop up a bunch with his mouth and drop it on the floor than eat it from there... But what ever he didn't finish he would always scoop it back up and put it back into his dish, thought I was interesting because he just screams dumb dog.

Our Border Collie used to love chewing on cushions and racing around with them. We generally let her, but we wouldn't let her take them outside, and she knew this.

I have a Pomeranian Maltese mix, and when he was about a year old I was sitting on the couch on a Saturday morning, and unbeknownst to me his water dish was empty from him drinking it overnight.  Instead of tapping his dish with his paw he went into my room, found a half full water bottle and carried it to me placing it upright by my feet then looking at me.  I immediately got the message and replenished his water and gave him treats. I am still amazed by how nonchalant he was that morning.

Our cat Jiggy, a short-haired all-black cat understands English.

He was about 7 when we got a pair of short-hair tuxedo kittens, boys, and littermates. When they started exploring the outside world (they're inside/outside cats that get locked in at night,) we were ready to go to bed one night and they were nowhere to be found. 

We looked at Jiggy and said, "Where are your brothers? Go get the little boys!" (Our nickname for them.)

Jiggy vanishes out the back cat door in a flash. About five, six minutes later the two kittens, their tails a little "poofed" come running in the back door looking a little harassed. 

Ten seconds after THAT, Jiggy comes back in and sits looking back and forth between us and the kittens like, "Anything else you need done?"

My late cat always knew when someone was sick. Maybe we smelled different or maybe it was just that we were lying down too much.

After I had back surgery and was knocked out from painkillers, my grandmother heard the cat yowling. She found him on my chest, going MEOW *nudge* MEOW *nudge* to try to wake me. As I started to recover, he'd stand next to my bed and howl, even when he wasn't hungry, until I got up. Then he'd jump on the bed and sprawl out so I didn't get back in. I can only guess he thought that if I moved, I'd get better.

I had a dog named Rusty, when I was living on my own in a townhouse complex. She used to roam around in the townhouse complex with a few other dogs. 

The kids that used to play of an afternoon all knew her, and I could call her at any time and a minute or 2 later should would jump through the waist hight front window in the living room, it was her doggy door that I didn't have.

My neighbor told me when I was moving out that one day she saw her little dog named Cindy a little maltese terrier thing getting harassed by another dog and she told me that Rusty came running in and leaped paws first pushing the other dog.

My hedgehog lives in one of those blue kiddy pools. She has wheel to run on, a plastic igloo to hide under when she wants, a blanket to sleep it (which she sometimes moves under the igloo), and a little archway she likes to run underneath in the middle of her pool. 

She used to have a litter box, too, but now we just put her bedding directly on the pool floor. We do this because one night when she was around a year old, she pushed her archway to the side of the pool, then pushed her litter box from one side of the pool to the other so it was right next to her igloo. She then climbed into the litter box, then on top of her igloo, and then out of the pool. Needless to say, we were terrified until we found her napping in a pillowcase that had been left on the floor (with the pillow still inside).

Aside from climbing, I think she aspires to be a professional home decorator. After I clean her pool, it doesn't really matter how I set it up again; she'll move things to exactly the place and position she wants them in. At one point, she'd moved her blanket so that it was halfway under the igloo, and halfway sticking out by her food and water dishes. She did this so she could go from underneath her igloo to dishes without ever leaving her blanket.

My terrapin recognises people. He swims towards my mum because she feeds him and bathes him most of the time. On the other hand, he ignores me. He also comes when called. He could be facing one direction when basking but when my mum calls him, he will turn around. Also, we keep his food in a cabinet that's visible from his tank. When we open the cabinet, he gets really excited as he knows it's feeding time.

I had a cat growing up that absolutely hated me. She would hiss at me as soon as I entered the same room as her. Other than the hissing she never really made any other noises other than the meowing for food.

I remember one time I was the only one home and she was in the basement sitting on the steps meowing and looking over towards something out of view. She looked up at me and back over and continued meowing. As I walked down the steps to get a better view of whatever she was meowing at she ran up the steps and tripped me. I fell down the steps and she just sat at the top of the steps staring at me.

I am pretty sure my cat I grew up with tried to kill me. I am glad to say I outlived the fucking thing.

Our pit bull mix here did most of the work raising this cat. She was bottle fed, and we had to wipe her with a moist cotton ball to make her pee. He figured out that licking was easier (that's what mama cats do). He'd also watch her if we weren't around. She'd lie between his front legs and play with his tags and he just patiently waited for her to tire out. 

TL;DR: big mean looking dog was nice to intruding baby cat

I've got a cat who comes inside and just meows in his stupid high pitched meow until we feed him his cat treats. Then he goes around the house and sits and meows until he gets what he wants. If he wants a drink he sits on the sink in the bathroom and meows u till we fill it up. If he wants outside he'll sit at the door meowing. If it's play, next to his toy. He knows if he's loud and makes a big scene he gets what he wants

He's such a fucking nuisance sometimes but by god we all love him to bits

One evening, my ex and I were in the middle of a pretty intense argument; I had found out he was still talking to his ex. My dog, a deer-head Chihuahua named B, was at the door signaling potty time, so we paused the argument and took him outside, where we continued the conversation. I didn't leash B because he is the type who would just lay down on the spot when leashed and not move. So we're outside, it's dark, and we walked him over to this abandoned gas station parking lot right next to where our apartments were located. At this point, the argument picks back up and a few minutes later I realize B is nowhere to be seen. Panic hits me, our apartments were right of a busy highway in Talladega, 18-wheelers barrelling all the time, and behind these apartments was the biggest corn field I'd ever seen. We both start to panic and run around the apartment complex several times, shouting "B!", whistling, even asking neighbors outside if they'd seen him. I'm an emotional wreck, sobbing and shouting for my baby dog. After ten full minutes of exhausting my voice, I see him. He was sitting right at the edge of the corn field, just watching us. I yell for him to come but he just stares. I run over to him and scoop him up, I'm still crying but he gives me kisses. This little dog was so distraught that we were arguing that he went and hid from us, like a child would do if they're parents were arguing. It blew my mind.

My dog saved my life one time! I had a procedure done and was recovering but I guess I took too much pain medicine. He would bark in my face until I woke up every two hours, follow me to the bathroom where I would splash water on my face and then pass out again! An hour or so later he would wake me up again!

To keep my old dog occupied, we would put a bone shaped treat inside one of those Kong footballs with holes on the ends. The holes were smaller than the ends of the bone so we figured there was no way he could get it out without breaking the bone. 

Eventually he started rolling on his back with the Kong in his mouth with the holes vertical, trying to get the bone to fall out. When this didn't work, he actually figured out that by squeezing the Kong with his paws, he could change the shape of the hole, elongating it and allowing the treat to fall out. 

We stopped giving him these to occupy him after that, because it only took seconds for him to get the treats out.

I have a bunch of cats. One of them, Gwen, is too smart for her own good. She also loves getting out and getting into trouble, eating trash and starting fights with other cats, so we keep her inside.

She recently had a litter, and she's nursing them, so she *really* can't go outside. We already dewormed everyone, and for those of you who don't know, that's how kittens get worms without drinking contaminated water, from the mother, and those worms can be fatal. So we keep her inside because every time she goes outside she eats trash and drinks water from the street and eventually gets worms again.

Recently, we've been keeping an eye on her, but she still tries to get out. She's already shown an aptitude for opening doors and hatches, even locked ones, but that's not the smart thing. We love these little kittens so much, they're a huge distraction and she noticed that when we cuddle them or play with them, we're entirely focused. She also notices that if we find them outside of her nest, we'll put them back so they don't get stepped on by us or our dog. So she starts her new plan at escape.

She'll bring one of these kittens over from her nest and place them at our feet and while we're playing with the kitten, she starts working on the window latch and tries to open the door. We stop her, of course, but she learns and adapts. Now, she brings two kittens, one for myself and my wife, then she makes her bid. No dice. Now is where she gets really crafty. They were at that stage still where they hate being alone and start crying if they get lost or are alone, since they're still blind they just cry until you pick them up and/or put them back in the nest.

Her new plan is craftier than ever. Now, she starts hiding them. She puts one between the couch and the wall, making us move the couch out to get to it. This gives her almost enough time. The second try involves her hiding one in a book shelf amidst the various books and knick knacks. This one took forever to find, because there's just so many places to search. We finally find the little kitten and notice she's squeezed halfway through a crack in the window, her butt stuck in the air, legs kicking. We pull her back in and put her with her babies.

Then, one day, I'm doing some chores outside, and I find her making her way through the front path on her way to freedom. I retrieve her and bring her back inside. I find my wife searching. Turns out, she hid all four at the once, and the cacophony of cries made it even harder to zero in on where they were hidden, and during this final distraction, she made her first successful escape attempt.

We have since tied the windows shut.

Had a cat try to kill the dog. There was a bar of chocolate on top of the coffee maker. Cat jumped up and brushed it onto the floor for the dog to eat. Dog ate it; didn't die. Months later, cat was sleeping on the edge of the bed. Dog snuck up and nosed her in the rear; cat had a stroke and died.
NEXT
My hamster spent most of her time trying to escape from her cage. She used to climb up the bars and chew them. This had been going on for several months, with no luck. 

So one day, I decided to give her a hint. I showed her where the door to the cage was, and went back to gaming. A few seconds later, I heard the cage door open. She was holding on the the bars, looking very surprised. And then she started to climb out. 

I put her back in the cage, and close the door. But within seconds, she got it open again. She never forgot how to open it.

That said, I used to give her a food when she was holding onto the bars. She would grab it with both of her front paws, and fall backwards. She never learned her lesson...

My cat is terrified of my Roomba. She has discovered that if she bats at it while it is at the charging station it will move slightly to try to get back to the charging station. 


She does this repeatedly until it is out of batteries and can't return to charge, thus removing the threat.

My mother had a cat that would wonder the neighborhood all day. Sometimes, he didn't come home before she went to bed. Normally, he'd just be waiting at the front door when she woke up. But, if it was raining, he'd go next door and ring the neighbor's doorbell, since it was just above a brick ledge.

My late pet rabbit, either intentionally or completely by accident, discovered the secrets of sustainable agriculture. After eating barren the patches of grass closest to her den, she realized that by rotating which crop of grass she focused on eating, no patch would go barren from the field. From that moment on, no patch of grass, spare the toilet patch, was noticeably longer than another.

She also beat the shit out of an opossum.

I was at the dog beach a couple weekends ago and there was a 5 month old pitbull pup that really attached to my girlfriend and female friend who were sitting in our beach chairs. This little grey pup would constantly stray from her owners who were posted up about 40 feet away and stand between the chairs defending her new friends from any passing dogs with adorable barks. Well my year and a half old american bulldog/lab mix got a little jealous when she realized what was happening. The little pit tried to stand her newly conquered ground but soon realized that she was the one who was trespassing. There was a tussle which consisted of some barking and a little wrestling that sounded much worse than it actually was. Usually my dog has no issues with inviting new friends into the mix but it seemed like she wanted to teach the little one a lesson. The pit pup was a little shaken and retreated with her tail between her legs. My dog then proceeded to walk calmly over to the pup and drop her prized squeaky football at her paws and roll it over to the apprehensive pit as a peace offering. It was an extremely humanizing move from a dog that refuses to give up her toys to anyone, ever. It may not be the most intelligent thing ever but it was a whole new level of conflict resolution for me to see from my dog and melted a few hearts of nearby onlookers.

My dog once opted not to eat his poop.

The cat I had growing up would point at the door when she wanted to be let in.  We had a kitchen window right beside the back door, and when you were in the kitchen, she would get up on the table outside the window and point with her paw toward the door, multiple times.  She did it regularly for years.  Didn't really start until she got older, though I don't know if it took her that long to figure out the trick, or she just wanted to be inside more then.  
NEXT
My dog still does it and there's nothing I can do about it.

He asks for the door. I get up and go open the door. When I get to the door, he bolts for my spot on the couch.

I can't not open the door. I taught him to ask for it when he needs to go. About 9 times out of 10, it's for real. He's been doing this for 6 years.

I have 2 cats, who go outside, during the day they can go in and out the catflap as they like, but we want them inside after they had dinner at 6pm. The catflap has 4 positions (in/out, not in/out, in/not out and not in/not out) so we put it at in/not out so both cats are inside for food and can't get out anymore. 
But often -somehow- we spotted one of the cats outside again after dinner.

Turns out that lil mfer lifts, with his claw, the flap inside and sneaks outside again.

I have a Rottweiler Great Dane mix so hes absolutely huge

I was sitting on my stoop and I typically have my dog with me so people can say hi to him when they walk by. Basically everyone on my block knows him, hes a great neighborhood dog.

One day like 3-4 years ago, a guy ran down the block really fast, followed by a small spanish lady who was yelling that the guy robbed her. This is Bushwick Brooklyn so that's not exactly uncommon. My dog just zoomed at the guy in an instant and tackled him to the ground and bit into his arm quickly, barking in his face like a police dog once he had him there. I ran over and we got the stuff from the guys pocket, and my dog just sat on him so he couldn't move. I swear to god I was so happy to have such a great dog. 

Cops came and almost shot my dog once they saw him though, it was awful, they came out of their car with their guns out aimed at my dog like they were ready to shoot the second he moved. Luckily they didn't cause I called him to me, but it was REALLY fucking close. The guy went to the hospital for the bite wound and then to jail I presume.

I have a three month old pup who got dirt in her eye one day. Th eye kept tearing up and she held it partilly shut for a few hours. During that time I felt really bad for her and handed out a lot of treats. Since then, when I am eating, she begs by winking that eye with a tiny whimper. Her wink is nonstop. If she's called by someone else in the home she looks at them with perfect eyes. I get the "broken eye" Once she gets the goods -fully working eyes.

She is a mix from a stray.

We had a Dachshund growing up and he could tell when my mom was going to have a seizure. He would start circling her over and over, barking.

Ironically, he ended up with epilepsy himself but it didn't shorten his lifespan. They helped each other out. He lived 17.5 years! I miss that dog.

Edited to add: My mom had epilepsy since she was 15. Unrelated to dog, which she got in her 30's. Our dog wasn't trained. He just did it.

Everyday when my brother and I pull in the driveway from school we can see our dog on my brothers bed in the window above the garage, where he knows he isn't allowed to be.

I had a yabbie in my freshwater tank that is a genius. I one day watched him gather some food pellets into his cave, wait for the fish today eat the rest then a few minutes later place them in front of the cave entrance, then attacked and ate a fish that came to eat the pellets.

They figured out that if they want the toy or bone the other has, to go to the front door and bark like a stranger is walking up to the house. When the other dog shows up to assist in barking, run like hell to get the toy. It's not just clever but dishonest in the worst kinda way.

Growing up, I had a yard that was surrounded by fence except at the entrance where the cars came in at the front. My dog knew she wasn't allowed to go outside the yard so when we'd call her and she was out gallavanting, she would go to the neighbor's yard in the back, hop the fence and come back over then strut around the back side to the front like 'hey, I've been been here the whole time!' I only found out because one day I was walking around the house calling for her and caught her. Sneaky bitch.

I had a cat that learned how to open the fridge, and then my dog started begging my *cat* for food. And then the cat started getting into the fridge just to feed the dog.

We were looking after a friends dog. We came home from work in the evening with a huge pile of dirt by the front door. The dog (unlike every other time we came home) was lying on the couch looking very guilty about something (you know the look). It took us forever to figure out where the dirt came from. We had an old flower pot downstairs on a shelf. The pot had been emptied by the front door and the pot returned to the shelf like nothing had happened.

I have two horses, Red, and Mickey.

They are yarded next to each other, and there is enough of a gap in the fence that a clever horse may work out that they can just manage to pinch the others hay through it.

Red took it a step further and realised that if he could steal Mickey's hay, Mickey could steal his...

So he waits until Mickey is distracted by his bucket feed, and then Red takes his own hay from his own feeder and deposits it across the yard, where it's safe.

He then goes back and takes Mickey's hay and deposits it where it is safe.

Then Red eats his hard feed and two lots of hay.

We had to move all the hay feeders.

My dog knows my caller ID.  I sometimes need to call home from my cell, and our home phone "speaks" the incoming call's caller ID.  The only time my dog ever howls is when I call and the answering machine says my ID.  She's done it when my mom is off somewhere else in the house and can't hear the phone ringing.  She doesn't do it for any other phone call, even if I'm not home.  I also tried calling while I'm still home to see if I can get her to howl, but she just looks at me like I'm an idiot.

My dog also has two bowls: one for food and one for water.  Whenever I give her some crushed ice to lick in the water bowl, she'll pick up chunks of the ice and put them in the food bowl instead.  Apparently, solids = food bowl, even if said solids turn into water.

Edit: Seems like people like my dog!  She learns a lot of things on her own and doesn't really care what I think, which can cause me a lot of headaches... but I wouldn't trade her for anything in the world.

Dog jumps up on the couch

One of my cats learned how to turn the internet off. I mean, he realized everbody goes crazy when he goes behind the TV stand and messes up with the wires.


So when we're not paying enough attention to him (usually if we're on our phones or the computer), he just unplugs the router. I don't think he knows how much power he has.

Every morning for breakfast I always eat fruit and that weekend there was a farmers market selling fruit for cheap so I bought a TON. I couldn't fit them in the fridge so I left a few bags on the side in the dining room (reachable distance)

I shit you not, I woke up and was surprised to see an apple next to me. Over the next few days, my dog would get up in the morning, go in the bag, and get a fruit to put next to me on the bed. He proceeded to do this for the next two weeks until we ran out. I thought it was the cutest thing ever but a part of me is like holy shit.

When my dad was having a difficult time in life he moved into my apartment. He's really into sports and mostly deaf so when he enthusiastically cheers for his beloved Detroit Tigers, he doesn't realize how loud he is. One early evening while I was asleep (because I work midnights) the Tigers scored or something and my dad loses his mind, which woke me and my cat up. I grumbled and closed my eyes but my cat Mike, was not having it. She walked into the living room and all I hear is my dad go "Oh, sorry. I'll be quiet." And then my cat walked back into my room, jumped back on the bed and we both went back to sleep. 

Edit: I adopted mike from the humane society when she was 3. She came with the name Michah. I didn't want to give her an identity crisis so I just shortened it to mike or mikey.

We used to keep my childhood dog in the garage while we were at school. She once found an old garage door opener, figured out how it worked, and buried it in an old dead potted plant in the garage... when we left for the day she would nose around in the dead plant till the door opened and go play with the neighbor's dog.. in their living room, because she also figured out hot to open their sliding door and let herself in.

Edit: Finding out was actually just luck. I had a half day from school. She had been getting out pretty much every day and we had no idea how the door was getting opened. I was walking up the driveway, the door opened and I saw her coming from over in that direction. Her nose had dirt on it and there was dirt on the ground, wasn't too hard to piece together once this happened.

My cat was sleeping on her cat tree when I walked over to look through stuff on the table next to the tree. I scratched her on the head and woke her up, then turned away to do whatever it was I was there for. 

I felt a tap on my shoulder, so I turned around and as soon as I was facing the cat she reached out and smacked me across the face. She then went back to sleep.

Not so much worrying as it is somewhat annoying and funny, but my golden will walk up to the Xbox, look at the Xbox button, boop it with his nose and wait for the light to turn on and the chime to sound, and then just walk away all satisfied looking. 

For a couple of months I would come home from work and notice the Xbox was on but know I had turned it off. I accused my fiancée of leaving it on until one day I was in the next room and heard the chime. So I ran in and he was walking away from it. Then he started to get flagrant about it and do it right in front of me, and eventually turn it off if I was playing it and he wanted my attention. Goldens are a trip. 
NEXT
My cat will look very intensely at where I'm sitting making me think I'm sitting on a toy or maybe some treats so I'll get up and she'll quickly curl up in my spot so I can't sit back down.  Then I have to go find a new seat to sit in.  She taught the other one to do it too.  They are seat stealing assholes. 
NEXT
I would do the old trick when my cat yawns to stick my finger in his mouth - dunno why I do it, I guess it's just funny to see his expression when boom!, suddenly finger.

So the other day he is sitting on my lap, and I yawn, he wakes up and does a stretch, perfectly putting his paw in my mouth - boom! suddenly paw.

Still no idea if by accident or if planned. His smug expression afterwards makes me lean towards the latter.

Not as much smart, rather worryingly calculated. 

On Christmas eve I was wrapping the cats favourite treats because I'm that person. 

The 3 boys weren't too fussed about this but Amber, the princess, wanted the treats now. Of course she's a cat and has no concept of Christmas so I gave her one of her normal treats and put the presents away. 

She was not amused by this. 

Now the thing about Amber is that she NEVER came upstairs. She had tiny lil legs that made the journey too long so she commandeered the down stairs instead. 

But that night I was woken up by weird cat chirping. I opened my eyes and on the shelf eye level across from me was Amber. I was confused as to a) why she was up stairs and b) how she got on my shelf. As I was thinking this, whilst maintaining eye contact she stuck out a paw and swiped one action figure off the shelf. I didn't react at first so she did another. And another. By the third I realised what she was doing and I said her name in shock to which she hopped off the shelf and left my room like it was nothing.


And that confirmed my suspicions that Amber held grudges. And exacted revenge.

One of my cats systematically tests for weaknesses in my door.  He jingles my keys on the wall, he KNOWS that that noise gets that door to open.  He's finally managed to unlock the deadbolt with his little paw.  If that fucker could turn the doorknob he'd be gone.

**My fat cat** has devised an alarm system by laying on top of my foot or having his foot touch my foot whenever possible so that when I get up, if he is sleeping, he will wake up JUST IN CASE I am going to feed him...

My dog understands Christmas.

As in, he will sit where the tree goes throughout November. Once the tree is up, he'll lie beside it crying. Once there are presents, he'll paw at them and carry them to us because he wants to open them. On Christmas he starts trying to wake everyone up around 5 and begins howling around 7.

And I kid you not, he will open his presents like a 5 or 6 year old and excitedly run around with a toy or treat for a minute before looking for the next present. One year we had less than 5 things for him to open, so he stole a present from me.
NEXT
My cat taught herself to fetch and hugs my arm for attention. She learned that when I tap twice on a surface I want her there. She follows me around because I give her hugs and food. She also knows that she shouldn't go outside (she was a stray) and stays clear of accidentally opened doors now.
NEXT
My dog is afraid of the smoke alarm.

After a while he discovered the toaster could set the alarm off if toast burned. So he became scared of the toaster.

Eventually he figured out the noise the bread bag made as it preceded the toaster noise, so he  became scared of that.

Eventually he figured out the kettle turning in usually accompanied the bread bag noise, so he became scared of that. 

Now we have just reached the point that he has figured out the time of day we go into the kitchen to turn on the kettle and open the bread bag, so he has scheduled his fear to that.

I am always blown away how he has been able to figure all this out. Not sure if it is really that smart but it impresses me 

Edit: To clarify: the smoke alarm has only actually gone off once ir twice, but he remembers it well. We are also training him with treats to not be scared. He is also a chihuahua cross, so being scared of noises is kinda his thing

Remus usually uses his brains for evil, but he's remarkably good at knowing when I have nightmares and waking me up, often before I realize that the nightmare is happening. He sleeps right next to me and always has to be touching me with his paw so that he knows when something is up - best cat ever.

He's also remarkable at knowing when I'm depressed and need to get moving/out of the house/go do something. I've got a housemate who's allergic to cats, so he stays in my bedroom or with me in my office while I'm working and if he notices I'm spending too much time laying in bed, he'll go scratch and meow at the door and generally making a ruckus to get me up, moving, and working. What's even neater is he somehow knows the difference between me chilling because I'm on vacation or have the flu or something and won't bother me then.
NEXT
Where to begin with this question... My pup knows that she's not allowed in the kitchen so she assumes that the cat isn't allowed either. Of course when he inevitably goes in there, she'll run over and either do a quiet bark or nudge my feet until I'll look at her and she'll herd me towards the kitchen to tattle tale. Same goes when the cat is scratching on furniture he's not supposed to be or meowing. Can't think of anything else at the moment but this definitely isn't the only example!

My cat was displeased to be shut out of the bedroom when one of us was playing with the Occulus Rift. So she scaled the laundry rack to the top of the bathroom door, jumped from there to the roof window, ambled across the roof and dropped down into the bedroom through the other open window. Then jumped on my husband's lap. He was rather surprised, as you can imagine. She was 6 months old at the time.

My dog likes to sleep in the kitchen. Most nights I am up late on my desktop working which is near the kitchen.

During my teens I had a cat and a dog. The dog door that led outside had a door that we could close and lock with a latch. The cat learned how to not only shut the door but lock it as well. So she started locking the dog outside when he went out.

He was a cowardly dog, so really she just had to sit inside in front of the door and he'd be too nervous to come back in.

My 16 year old dog knows my two puppies can get up the stairs but won't go back down. So when they are annoying him by trying to get him to play, he will play for a few seconds to get them to chase him, then run straight upstairs with them following. As soon as they are up he turns round and walks downstairs before going back to sleep.

He also uses an angled mirror in my room to spy on the stairs from his basket. You can tell he knows it is a reflection and not the real thing because if you gesture for him to come from the top of the stairs he will run straight round the corner to you and not to the mirror.

Door handles on a door that opens in the direction of travel are easy for a Great Dane, just a swipe of a paw and they're through. But a [Yale night latch] on a front door that opens in? That needs a fine grip between the front teeth, rotation in the correct direction and then back up slowly to pull the door open. And the sneaky thing learned how.

I had a cat named Buddha and I'd had him for about 3 years. I noticed that there was pee in the toilet so I asked my boyfriend if he'd stopped flushing or what. Then one day, we were both in the bathroom and he said "What is Buddha doing?" Buddha was on the toilet, peeing into it! He must have learned from watching me. I never taught him. He only peed in there, no poop but it was the funniest thing. I have a picture of it because no one believed me. God, I miss him.

When my dog doesn't want to be outside, she pretends to pee.  She makes eye contact with me while she squats to pee... only she isn't very good at pretending to pee for a convincing amount of time.  She will do it for about one second.  Then she gets excited and does her good girl jumps and spins and acts like it's time to come back inside.

He's a dick. But such a sweet baby.

I had a service dog a few years ago. At the time I was staying with my mother for the weekend because I was in between leases on apartments. That being said, Jude, one day decided he would jump into my mother's lap and then paw at her face. Something he'd never done before and he ended up scratching a good size cut on her upper lip close to the nose.

How was this worryingly smart? The skin looked strange to my mother and me, she made an appointment at the doctor's office, and we found out she had skin cancer in that exact spot. My mother ended up having surgery to remove the cancer. 

As of today all is well. My mother is doing fine, Jude is still a good boy and gets lots of love for what originally thought was "him being a brat."

Before we moved overseas, we gave our cat to a family friend who lived 100 miles away. Our cat went missing, and was found some time later on the opposite side of a divided highway from our exit. He was so close, but he couldn't figure out how to cross over without getting hit. 

This was no straight shot, either. He went missing in Montauk, NY and was found in Westchester, which some of you will recognise means he walked across the entirety of New York City.

I have two russian blue cats that hate each other. One has a crinkle toy that it loves. Long story short: the other cat took her paw and crinkled the toy three times, then walked slowly behind the corner to wait for the other cat to come into the room so she could beat the piss out of her.
NEXT
My cat learned how to turn on the television.  More importantly the cat has a favorite show.

So my daughter would come home from school and if she had a good day I'd let her watch television as she had her afternoon snack.  She invariably chose "cute cat videos" on YouTube.  She would sit on the couch with our cat next to her and both of them would watch with full attention.

One day, while my daughter was at school, I heard the TV turn on by itself.  I got up to investigate and I saw the cat standing on the couch mashing its paws on the remote, looking at the TV, then looking back at the remote to mash buttons.

I realized that the *cat* wanted to watch cute cat videos even though his human wasn't home yet.  When I turned on YouTube to do just that, the cat settled down and watched attentively.

The cat will now, occasionally come to me, my wife, or my daughter, dragging, or batting the remote across the floor, when he wants to watch TV.

Back when I was a kid, my family had an incredibly intelligent Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. She had somehow managed to learn several dozen different words, to the point where we could tell her to go find certain people, to wait for us in certain rooms, or to pick out specific items from her collection of about fifteen different toys. This dog would even obey remarkably detailed commands combining those elements, like "Go get your hedgehog, then bring it to Dad in his office."

Suffice to say, she was a damned remarkable pet.

Now, this dog's favorite toy was a little stuffed animal that was vaguely shaped like a human, which we referred to as her "baby." She would wrestle with it, tote it around the house, and keep it right next to her whenever the family would gather to watch a movie or something. After a year or so of such adventures, though, the toy started to get a little bit worn out, so my mother decided to replace it. In an effort to "surprise" the dog, she discreetly put the old baby in the garbage, then stood in the middle of the living room with the new one behind her back.

"Kayodee!" my mother called. (The dog's name was "KOD," though we pronounced every letter.) "Kayodee, come here!" As expected, the dog came bounding into the room, a happy spring in her step. "Where's your baby? Go get your baby!"

Everyone expected the dog to approach the corner where her toys were kept, discover the item was missing, then mount a search for it. She'd done similar things in the past, after all, with "Hide-and-Seek" being one of the many games she seemingly enjoyed... but rather than behaving as anticipated, KOD trotted over to the trash compactor and started pressing on its foot pedal with her paws. She wasn't heavy enough to get the thing open, but the intention was clear enough.

In the end, KOD wound up with two babies.

**TL;DR: Clever canine counters caper.**

My wife told me a story about a worryingly smart, and a worryingly dumb dog. 

Her family lived on a couple acre property in a very rural area. They had a raccoon going through their garbage and getting in the garage, so they set up a live trap. 

The dumb dog followed the smart dog everywhere, he basically stared at the smart dog while running next to him. Smarty learned to lead Dummy wherever Smarty wanted him to end up. Smarty ran next to a fence post, for example, and dummy ran snack into it.

Eventually Smarty got bored. One day after running Dummy in to a ditch, the kennel wall, and various other amusing things, Smarty thought it would be good fun to run Dummy straight into the live raccoon trap! Dummy never learned what was going on, and not to follow Smarty without watching where he was going. I wish I had been there, my wife can't tell the story without laughing (maybe because she tells it better than I do.)

My dogs are stupid idiots so this may not exactly be *worryingly smart* but one of my pups has successfully punked me a couple times when it comes to stealing my take-out food.   
 
He knows the rules and obeyes them generally, he's no anarchist. But he's smart enough to bluff like, when I'm chowing on my indian takeout he'll politely pace around avoiding eyecontact, like humblin his ass to the rules he knows he is supposed to follow. Out of the blue he'll snap into action and snag a dumpling and flee into the yard to feast on or bury that shit.   
 
He's learned that if he acts fishy I'll keep my guard up, but if he acts like a good boy I might slack some and trust him, so he'll throw down the bait and switch.

The other day, My Jack Russell wouldn't relax and was staring at our other dog laid in the dog bed. A few moments later he wanders over to the back door and sits, hinting he needs to go take a piss. He knows that this a group activity, and in the evening both dogs have to go out to the toilet before bed so I shouted our other dog who got up and came to the door, as soon as i opened the backdoor, instead of going out, he runs towards the bed to shotgun it for the night.

Both worryingly smart, and concerningly stupid. My cat learned to close the door.

His method was non-typical, and involved jumping onto the nearby cabinet, and onto the top of the door (crucially, ontop of the door close to the wall). He would then make his way along the door, and jump back to the cabinet from the top of the door, furthest from the wall.

The cat was able to work out the moment difference to determine that this would exert a net positive amount of force and close the door. He was unable to work out that simply putting his paw on the door, from the floor, would have the same effect.

My cat is "engineer smart". I.e. quite intelligent, but fundamentally stupid.

My rabbit has these plastic rings that link together to make kind of a chain thing. One end is attached to the top of the cage and it hangs down and I put a bell on the end so he can entertain himself in the cage with it (along with tons of other toys). It hangs a bit higher than the height when he's sitting so he has to put some effort standing up up his back feet to get to it. One morning I notice he's pushing his pillow to the center of the cage, he then proceeds to stand on top of the pillow, using it as a step stool so he can reach the bell with no effort. Smart little shit.

When I lived with my parents we had an enclosed garden for the cat.

My dad would go out of town overnight. When he was away he was outside a lot and didn't eat as many snack between meals. He had a travelling bag that would be in his computer room when he was home. Our cat figured out the she can find out if he's home by checking if the bag is there.

Then he was talking about the lack of snacks while the cat heard him. He also mentioned that he was leaving soon. Our cat proceeded to go out, catch a mouse, not kill it and put it in his bag.

I have Rats. 6 boys in one cage, 4 girls in another & a solo boy in his own separate cage. Solo boy has behavioural issues so he can't be homed with anything but himself. I've tried everything from getting him snipped to going rediculously slow with introductions, nothing. He goes for the kill with everything, myself included. My partner was the one who found this out. Loki (the asshole in question) is able to open his cage door by putting all his weight on it, free roaming our apartment to do God knows what, then just fucks back into his cage whenever he's done. You're probably asking how he closes the door preventing us from noticing him escaping, right? Well, I had a chew toy on the door for him & this smart fucker literally just pulls on the damn chew toy.  I wouldn't of known he was getting out if it had not been for my partner waking up in the middle of the night to use the washroom. Smartest little asshole I've ever met. Fuck you Loki, I now know it's you who's been destroying my furniture & the reason why I won't get my damage deposit back. 😖🐭

I used to have a cat and he loved eating our leftover food (which I know is bad for him).  It got to the point where when we had dinner he'd sit on the table and stare at your plate waiting for you to finish.  I knew he'd got clever the day he was sitting there staring, and then he suddenly looked behind me and stared intently.  I turned around to see what was there (nothing of course) and in the time it took me to turn back he'd taken a piece of chicken off my plate and dived under the table to eat it!

No matter what time of year it is, no matter if it's still a little light out or completely dark, my little dog knows when it's bed time. And she will get up from where she is at, and start staring at me. At first eye contact, I can see her morph before my eyes. I swear she has little air pumps in her eyes because they start to get all big and sorry looking. Her ears drop and her whole demeanor is like you just pulled her out from under a dumpster. If I do not respond, she just sits there deteriorating. Still won't get up and go to bed? A loooong barely audible whine as her soul is slowly dying and all hope drains from her barely living body. But as soon as I stand up, poof. Like magic, she is instantaneously a whole new dog with hopes and dreams for the future. Oh no! False alarm! I was going to the kitchen. I sit down again and her eyes start inflating as she begins dying inside. 

I think she's faking.

I bought two cheap $30 auto-feeders for my two cats when I was planning hand surgery. I then found out the fat one isn't a lazy sack of shit, he is food motivated and smart as hell.

So began a 2-week battle of wits with the fat mofo. He learned he could put his paw in to pull food out, I added a barrier. He got around the barrier,  I reinforced it. He managed to bite the feeder, lift it up, and drop it to shake food out, I taped the feeder to a heavy base. This went on with a steady progression of modifications one day and the cat figuring it out the next. Eventually he just ran full force into the heavily modified feeder and shook food loose.

I now own two ironclad $130 feeders that he can't fuck with. I lost a battle of wits and wills with a 15 pound sentient pillow.

My dog (let's call her A) had a dog friend who was dumb as a brick  (let's call him B). When B's owners were out of town, he'd stay with us. A was a bit spoiled and had lots of bones and toys she never touched unless B wanted to have them. 

One day, when A was checking out who was cooking in the kitchen and if she could snag some food, B got ahold of one of her bones. B was a large dog and once he had something he wasn't giving it up. A was fairly big herself but she didn't compare to B. 

So A comes out of the kitchen and realizes that B has her bone that she hasn't touched in months and is having none of it. She knows from past experiences that she can't just snag the bone away from B, so she grabs a tennis ball and sneaks up behind him and drops it on his head. 

B stares up at the ceiling for about three minutes trying to figure out what's happening and A snags the bone and hides it. 

B looks down and sees that the bone is gone and then stares at the ceiling for another five minutes trying to figure out how it took his bone. 

Rest In Peace A. You were an amazing dog.

So I have 2 dogs. The Sheppard loves to eat peppers, the Mini Collie does not. Our next door neighbour has a nice garden with several pepper plants that the Sheppard covets but he can't get to them. There is a little hole in the fence though that the Collie can squeeze through. So she goes over, picks a couple and brings them back for him to eat.

In return he always gives up the comfy spot by the fireplace when she wants it.

It's a good partnership.

My cat uses my brother as a pillow. My brother is a rather large young man so he is the squishiest thing in the house.  She is also jealous of his girlfriend.  

My cat will calmly wait for food from me during dinner time. Then go to everyone else in turn. She pretends like she hasn't eaten in days. We all know it is a lie. She will steal the food she wants if she isn't handed said nibble. One day she stole half my chicken breast off my plate when I went to refill my water. 

She doesn't listen to me when I tell her to come inside. She listens to my 4 year old though. Why? The 4 year old will pick the cat up in a way cat hates (without foot support). If I tell her to come inside she expects to be carried comfortably.

My dog jacked off once

EDIT: OKAY for everyone asking why I was watching etc he wasn't exactly giving me any warnings when it happened. I was watching tv in the living room and all of a sudden my dog just gets up in his bed into a sitting position. We sort of exchanged a glance and I just figured whatever he probably just heard something outside. Couple minutes go by and he's making these weird groaning noises. Look over and his lipstick chub is FULLY EXTENDED onto the bed and he's sitting there rubbing it with one of his front paws. I then made a little bit of a fuss at him telling him he was nasty and to leave the room and he gets up and as he's walking away he was air humping uncontrollably funniest shit I have ever witnessed.

Not my pet, but... 

I found a dog on the side of the road once, took it in, tried to find it's owner (it had a chip, so the local shelter reached out to him for me), didn't hear from him immediately so I let this dog stay with me. When I took him to the shelter, they recognized him right off the bat, said he had been in before. Full-bred Australian Shepherd. Super sweet. Got along well with my cat. No accidents in the house. Clearly well-trained. 

Two days later, I go to work. Still no word from the owner. Let the dog roam free in the house during the day since he seemed so well-behaved. Boyfriend comes home mid-day. The dog and my cat are sitting outside in the front yard. All doors are shut and locked... My boyfriend, very confused, calls me wondering how the hell both animals are outside. Our first thought is that someone broke in. He goes inside and notices the window on the side of the house has the window slid up and the screen pushed out. 

We hear from the owner the next day (FINALLY - He had been out of town). I meet up with him to give him the dog. Explained to him what happened with the window. He said "Oh yeah, that happens all the time. He knows how to open windows."

I wouldn't necessarily call this "smart" but my beagle has come to the conclusion that the "reward" outweighs the punishment every time.

For example, beagles love food, like they won't let anything stop them from getting it. Whereas my pit/boxer could care less if there is a plate of food right next to her. 

My beagle knows how we will punish him after taking food, jumping on the counter stealing food, going through the trash, etc.

He knows he will get yelled at and scolded and not get treats for the night, yet he knows we won't seriously harm him or anything for a slice of pizza he stole off a plate.

When he does something bad he walks and sort of "acts" like he knew what he did was bad but he walks towards us like "yeah yell at me, I don't care, I got pizza."

I love my beagle to death and the fact that he knows pizza is worth getting yelled at for is hilarious.

Mine won't drink water when I'm away from home. Somehow she's made the correlation between drinking and having to go out. When i get home after work, she chugs an entire bowl while i wait, leash in hand.

My dog realized that it's not the escape from the backyard that gets her in trouble. It's being caught outside of the backyard. 
So, I would come home, she would be gone and I'd start calling for her frantically. I'd walk the neighborhood and eventually come back to the house where she would be patiently awaiting my return in the backyard. 
We had to put up an electric fence. 
Which she systematically checks for weaknesses. God forbid the battery in her collar dies or she'll headbutt the fence until a post comes loose.

my cats have done a few things that are tricky / smart but all that pales in comparison to [Ant Canada's yellow ants when they got carnivorous plants in their tank.]

I am aware that ants herd aphids like we do cattle but thats kind of a mutual trade: protection for the secretions off of aphids. I did not expect to to see ants showing that they understand that the pitcher plant is eating stuff and so should be fed the leftovers.

The dog realised this, and goes and rang the bell to be let out so that it can go and get the ball from outside and bring it back in.

Let me tell you a story. This happened a few years back. My golden retriever, sweetest guy, has never bitten anyone in his life. One of my father's friends comes over to visit, and my dog just presses against me, without making any noise. When the friend was leaving in his motorcycle, my dog bit him in the leg pretty bad. Stitches were needed. A few weeks after the bite, the guy was found with child porn on his computer.

TLDR; My dog discovered a pedophile.

When I started dating my now-wife, my orange female tabby cat *hated* her. I don't know if the cat considered her a rival or what, but if we sat together on the couch, the cat would sit nearby on a coffee table and glare daggers at us the entire time. If she tried to pet the cat, she'd get bitten for her trouble.

Time passes, the cat still hates her, and eventually I ask her to marry me. She says yes, we celebrate, I go back to my apartment to let my roommate know the good news. I told him, then went back into my room. I hear an odd yowling noise from the main room, so I go back out to see the orange cat circling the kitchen table, yowling mournfully. She did this for five solid minutes, yowling occasionally. 

She'd never done that before, and she's never done it again. I know, there's absolutely no way she could possibly know that I proposed or even the concept of what that means, but...I dunno...it was pretty damn bizarre. 
NEXT
A few things...

Mine will get my attention and will tell me what she wants by leading me to the object. Doesn't matter what it is, she'll lead me to it and point at it with her nose. She picked this up on her own.

Examples: Food, leash (walkies), leftover dinner scraps on the counter, a toy, bed (bedtime), cookie jar (treats). Even things she KNOWS she isn't allowed but she tries to 'ask' anyways (like wanting to rummage in the garbage).

She will alert one of us if a family member is having problems breathing or is making a sound she has never heard before. On one occasion, that was helpful because my father was choking in another room and I was unaware.  


I don't know if this is normal for dogs - the only other dog I had was lazy and I'm pretty sure he would have rather been a cat. But I loved the crap out of him anyway.

My Labrador can open doors. She would always open random doors in the house and one day, I walked out the front door and shut it behind me- next thing she opens in and runs out after me (thank god our front yard is fenced). Now we have to deadlock the door.

She also knows how to turn off the washing machine. She used to sleep in the laundry and if we'd put it on of a night time (it's a washing machine / dryer and the cycle goes for a good few hours), she figured out how to turn the whole thing off by the power button (which cancels the whole cycle too). We think she initially liked the funky beeping sounds it made when you switch it off. She's turned it on through the night time too and put it through a whole cycle and randomly turned it off so there would be water just sitting in there...

I have a [Neato robot vacuum] with the home base set up in the kitchen near my cat's food dishes. My 4yr old kid is scared of loud noises and thus is terrified of the vacuum. If my son is bothering the cat, she calming walks over to the vacuum and turns it on. My son runs away crying. She wins.

Well their was the rat that learned how to run on his hind legs. Or how he kept tricking people by looking cute and cuddly until they went within biting range, at which point he'd drop the facade and strike them. He also was able to understand locks and levers and similar physics. And if he didn't get the food he wanted or the treatment he wanted he would threaten us, menacingly moving towards us as if to bite.


He would also communicate to us when he wanted something, if the water bottle was empty he would go to it and start sneezing and rattling the bars; if the cage needed cleaning he'd get our attention and start sneezing deliberately. We used to call him doing this 'Letters to the Editor' as it was always done with the rage of the type of person who writes in to Sunday Newspapers about issues of the day.


He had a human presence and personality, to the degree that his resting expression looked more like the face of a human than a rat; he changed this when luring someone towards him, and he looked almost unrecognisable. Unfortunately he hated people, but if you treated him with respect, as if he were a human he liked that. If people cooed over him he would attack them, he hated being a little furry cute thing too.


He was put to sleep about 9 months a go, not a day goes by that I don't miss the psychotic little bastard

My girlfriend and I got a street cat from the shelter, and she's serious about her food. If she catches you opening your eyes in the morning its game over. She knows your awake and won't let you go back to sleep until she's been fed.

If you don't feed her, she'll go out of the room and make hacking noises like she's about to puke and then when you jump up she'll run over to her food bowl and stare you down.

She knows she's cute and takes full advantage of it.

When I first got my dog, he would wolf his food down then either get farts, vomit, or both. One day, he was eating as fast as caninely possible and I looked at him and said, "Breathe!"

Anytime we were going out and it was a nice day we'd leave our dog out in the back garden. But every time we came home he was gone missing and eventually an hour later he would show up outside the FRONT door, which was impossible cause we had walls all around our garden and two big side gates that he couldn't have gotten through.

One day we decided to try and find out what was happening so we pretended to leave the house, we put him out back, went and put the alarm on and opened/closed the front door. We creeped back up to the kitchen window and we saw him walking in behind our garden shed. We went outside and slowly & quietly walked up to the back of the shed and peered around. Turned out, he was climbing up the garden wall by putting his left two paws against the back of the shed and his right two paws against the wall and hoisting himself up (there was a small gap between the shed and wall) like some kind of spiderman-dog freak. He then got to the top of the wall and jumped out into freedom.

He's now 18 years old, blind and deaf but still going strong.


TL;DR:  my dog is going to be cast as the next Spider-Man. Watch out Tom Holland.

Had a cat living in the house, brought in a puppy. Puppy thought this was AWESOME.  A built in playfriend!!!  

The cat did not think this was awesome. 

Dog would walk up to the (clawless) cat. Poke the cat with his nose, yip once and get into "I'm ready to play" stance. When he did this, the cat would swat at the dog, hiss and back away.  

For the dog, this was a fun game, for the cat it was not. 

So we trained the dog.  

When he poked the cat, and the cat hissed we would step in. Say NO in a firm voice, move him away from the cat, have him sit and treat him.  We thought thus was working.  

Until one day when we realized the dog would poke the cat until he got a hiss, proudly march over to us, sit, and wait for his treat.

We put our dog in our bathroom once because he'd been bad, and we were going somewhere, so we wanted to contain him if he did anything else. When we get back, he greets us at the door. He managed to scratch a hole in the door it wasn't solid wood, but still impressive). However, there were also bite marks on the handle. He knew that the handle meant freedom, but he didn't have the dexterity to turn it, so he burrowed out instead.

This is also the same dog who has eaten a small amount of rat poison, and has privacy eaten his weight in chocolate over the course of his lifetime. He's very annoyingly resourceful

I read something that recommended leaving the room if your dog starts whining. My dog has a winning problem and putting him in the kennel was not working. 

My dog was bringing his rubber kong over and whining to play with him. I tried this new technique and left the room and went to the down stars bathroom.

So what does this damn dog do after I tried to punish him? He brings his kong over to the door and drops it right infront of the door. When i try to open the door after attempting teach him a lesson, I couldn't. He wedged his rubber kong into the door against the hardwood floor. I couldn't open the door without breaking it off the frame. I figured if I told him to pick the ball up he would, because he was so excited to play. Apparently he lost all interest after I tried to punish him. I had to wait in the bathroom untill my girlfriend could open the door.

One of my cats loves sleeping on drum machines. In doing so, and walking on them, she often programs far more interesting patterns than I would. I don't think it's just random either. She gets into menus that I wasn't even aware of sometimes, modifies patches, and doesn't push more buttons if she likes the beat.

My old cat Jasmine used to look both ways before crossing the road. She was amazing.

My cat likes to watch when I do dishes. He sits on the counter behind the sink and watches. Well one day he started handing me silverware, measuring cups, any small items he could carry he would bring to me to wash. About a week after that he would take them from me and put them in the drawer if I left it open. Well one day about a month ago I came home from work and saw him sitting by the sink. I'd left a dirty plate I used for eggs that morning in the sink, but it was sparkling clean, and he had the happiest proud look I've ever seen. There was a washcloth on the plate and the tap was dripping. I can only surmise he managed to turn on the water, wash the plate with a wash cloth (not hard since nothing was stuck onto it at all), and turn the water back off. Then he must have sat there waiting for me to get back. He's frighteningly smart, and he's shown it in several other ways. One morning I peed and didn't flush because I was tired and forgetful, and I was in the kitchen when I heard the toilet go off, so I checked and he was sitting on top of it pawing at the handle. There's also the habit he's adopted of turning my computer on for me before I get home. It only wakes up to the power button due to cats, but he figured it out and every day when I get home he's sitting on the desk and the PC is on.

My cat told me to go to bed once.

A few years ago I got into the habit of picking up my cat and taking him to bed with me, where he would just sleep next to me all through the night.

One night I was up a little later than usual, and my cat started meowing at me, trying to get my attention. I stand up and he runs out of the room. I assume he's hungry, but when I follow him he runs right past the kitchen, onto the stairs, where he waits for me. I get to the stairs, he runs up them. I get to the top of the stairs, he goes to my bedroom door. I get to the door, he jumps on my bed and stares at me. So I go over and sit on my bed, and start petting him. He immediately starts purring, lays down on the bed and goes to sleep.

He knew it was time for bed and he wouldn't go without me.

Oh boy:

My working line GSD Female. 

- Learned to operate "paddle handle" doors at about 3 months, and would let herself out. 
- Afterward learned to operate a normal doorknob by biting it and twisting it. 
- Within about 25 minutes, learned the trick behind the sliding glass door at my mom's house, bites that handle and pulls it open.THEN learned to move the stick that was blocking the door from being opened so she could go outside.  
- All doors in my house have to be locked or she will decide to let herself out. 
- [figured one of these out far too quickly]- then learned she could knock the whole thing over and hold the bottles in place. 
- Is impervious to the "tennis ball in the food" trick, because she simply picks up the tennis ball, moves it, and then goes to eat her food as quick as she wants. 
- Routinely tricks my 10yo German Shepherd by barking at the front door, he gets up and runs to the front door, then she runs and steals his toy.  
- Sometimes tricks me by whining like she has to go out (GSD's are very vocal and you can interpret their whine types after a while) then when she goes out, simply goes to get her frisbee toy. 

- Can easily tell when the treats in my hand run out, and will sometimes stop doing her training if she knows I know longer have treats in my hand.  
- When she got sick once and couldn't hold her poop, went inside the bathroom in the house to do it - I couldn't even be mad. 

- both know my running shoes mean a run, and my hiking bag means going on [a hike]

When I see my neighbors cats I give them a pet and walk on by. Some though want more attention and worked out a way to get it. As you walk off they run after you to stop and stand in front of your feet. So you can't walk without stepping on them and must give them more attention to be allowed to pass.

The dog I had when I was growing up was a border collie x blue heeler named Shiner. One day she managed to tear open a pad on her paw and we made a quick visit to the vet. Upon arrival back home we showered her with love and treats, especially as she hobbled around on three paws. 

Some time passed and we were getting worried that she still wasn't using the paw, even though the injury should have healed by now. Then one day my mom is looking out the kitchen window into the backyard and Shiner is running mock chicken at someone that was on the other side of our fence. All of a sudden she must have felt that she was being watched as she came to a stop and instantly lifted up her paw. In her haste she accidentally lifted up the uninjured paw. She hobbled a few steps towards the house before realizing her mistake and casually switched which foot was injured.

One of our goats pulled out the wooden peg the gate latches onto with her teeth, rendering the gate mechanism useless and inoperable. I've seen them push the latch up before when they want to get through, which is impressive enough, but disassembling it was some next level shit. And she wasn't just screwing around or just trying to eat it, she had been trying to get through that gate for several minutes.

My rabbit knows how to open doors and untie strings.

She figured out how to turn the knob on the sink just so she could play with the water whenever she wants.

My cat gave my husband a dead mouse by putting it on his phone. The thing that's clearly most important to him.
Also my cat and dog would team up for mouse hunts.
NEXT
My cat wouldn't leave me alone and made me follow him to the litter box and watch him pee. Or not pee since he had a crystal in his urethra. 

He even made me take the lid off to watch him. 

On multiple other occasions he alerted me that his idiot brother fell off the balcony. 

When we took him to the vet to have him put down he knew it was time and he waited patiently by the door and calmly got into his carrier.. 

This cat was smart.

This is not worryingly smart...more like, I'm here today because of my cat. I had just arrived home from school as an eleven year old. Nobody else was home. The cat always trotted towards the kitchen since I always fed her as soon as I got home. That day I had just bought a giant gobstopper (it was the 80's) and somehow inhaled the thing about three steps inside the house. The cat, halfway trotted to the kitchen, heard me make the weird sound of a giant ball of candy lodging in my throat and stopped to turn around and look at me...looked me straight in the eye very focused like. I knew I was fucked...couldn't breath in, couldn't cough and hadn't learned the self heimlich maneuver yet (throwing yourself on a chair back). I sort of sat heavily on a nearby couch starting to panic. Well the cat, with the very focused stare still in effect, charged at me...full cat sprint... and jumped hard on my stomach and out popped the gobstopper. I started sort of crying from the release of stress. The cat started purring and curled up in my lap. She saved her boy.

As we were cutting a pizza, our dog randomly laid besides the table apparently inoffensive. As soon as we lifted up one half of it, she immediately jumped up to get it and began ranning the fuck away with it. We've only had it for maybe two months and she's already beginning to pull shit like this lol.

When pizza is around she just loses her mind. Pasta? Meat? She doesn't care. But with pizza, man. My focus level peaks when I'm eating pizza and the dog is with me.

My parrot through stuff on the floor and when I go to pick it up she tries to 

A) Destoy something she's not allowed to touch. 

or

B) Eat some of my food or dunk her head in my drink.

A few years ago we left the TV on for our little dog, Earl while we went out. Thought the Winter Olympics might keep him company. Apparently, he found it lacked something. He went into the kitchen, opened the fridge, and pulled out two slices of leftover pizza. He then dragged the slices into the living room and onto the couch where he could eat his cold pizza and watch the biathlon. If he'd have cracked a beer it'd be like I never left the house. 
NEXT
Put one of those collars on her that would squirt some citrus spray when she barked. Well, the first time she triggered it, she stopped immediately. Then she gave a very muffled little bark. Then a little louder. She proceeded to bark progressively louder and louder until she set it off again, learning exactly how much she could get away with without setting off the spray.
NEXT
No specifics, but my German shepherd is a genius. He knows exactly what I want always. 

To counteract this I have the dumbest golden retriever in the history of dogs. 
NEXT
Once I told my cat to meow once for food and twice to go outside and the fucker meowed twice.
NEXT
My dog will get up in the morning and go pop open the door to the baby's room and wake him up, just so he can sneak back and steal my warm spot in the bed.
NEXT
My cat doesn't have a litterbox inside so always meows to be let out. If we are sleeping or dont hear her she just goes in the bath tub over the plughole. We didnt teach her this she just does it 😃🐺🚽
NEXT
She knows how to open the gates at daycare. According to the people that work there, she'll look around, open the gate, and then wait for other dogs to sneak into the hallway before she does so she looks less guilty.
NEXT
My Japanese spitz (aka cloud with legs) will run outside and bark until the Maltese goes outside to join her, then she will run back inside acting all innocent like she has done nothing, loving the fact that the Maltese will get in trouble for barking.

When my husband was in college, he was training our dog to do a trick for a psychology project. It was the trick where you put your hand out and the dog touches their nose to it. Well, our cat really likes treats, including dog treats, and will sit on the table and patiently wait for his treat whenever the dog gets one (like after he goes potty outside). So anyway, our dog wasn't really "getting it", and so there was a lot of repetition happening and the whole time the cat was sitting there watching and fuming that he wasn't getting his treats like the dog. Then suddenly my husband put his hand out and the cat rammed his face into it because he had figured out that's what the dog was supposed to do to get a treat. And then every time my husband put his hand out for the dog, the cat did a nose touch! (And got a treat, of course.)

He's also been intently watching every morning when the dog goes out and tried to open the door the other day. But thankfully he hasn't figured out yet that you have to push the bar up, not down to open it.
