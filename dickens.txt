When I was a kid, we had two dogs: a Pyrenean Shepherd, and a Labrador Retriever. The Retriever was a goofy idiot, but the Shepherd was *smart*.

One day, the Retriever gets loose (we had to tie him up in the yard because he kept chasing things and running away), and the Shepherd runs after him. We never even realized what had happened until we saw the Shepherd coming back with the Retriever, holding the would-be runaway's leash in his mouth, and leading him back to the house. 

Must have been a weird sight for the neighbors.

I used to have a border collie/German Shepherd mix named ash. We had a 6 foot chain link fence with about an acre-sized backyard for him to roam freely. One day, we couldn’t find him and an hour later he was back in the yard. As his escapes happened more often, I decided to watch him from the window. He would stick his front paws in the fence, pull himself up so his lower legs went in the fence, then put his front paws on top of the fence and climb over it like a goddamn human. He could do it from the other side as well and never hurt himself doing it. I was so impressed I wasn’t even mad at him when he continued doing it for the remainder of his life. He was the smartest animal I ever had. 
NEXT
I had a genius ferret.  All of my ferrets were smarter than you might expect, but Mia was ridiculous.  I have tons of stories, but here’s my favourite.

My roommates and I used to hangout in a TV room that had door way with no door (entranceway?).  Since I wanted the ferret to be able to run around while we were there, I put a baby gate across the exit.  Took her ten seconds to climb it, of course.

I then wrapped the gate in carpet runner, so she couldn’t scale it.  She tried for a long time, but could find anything to get a grip on.  Three of us are all kind of marveling at her commitment. 

She stops trying to climb, and just freezes for a minute, her eyes panning around the room like she’s concocting a scheme, and then she starts eyeballing a shoebox on the other side of the room.  Eyes up on the gate, back to the box, back to the gate.  My buddy says “No fucking way.  You think she’s figured it out?”

She walks over to the box and starts sliding it across the floor, stopping every foot or so and checking her progress.  Finally gets to the gate, hops on the box and jumps up and grabs the top of the gate.  Whoop she’s up and over and dancing down the hallway.

We used to have this dog when I was younger, she learned how to open our fridge and she would eat almost everything in it. It got so bad that my mom had to buy a child proof lock for our fridge, she ran a daycare so it was always funny when parents asked about it and she had to explain it was for our dog and not the daycare kids.

A couple years ago, my grandmother who doesn’t walk very well anymore fell while walking in the living room. 

They have a plot of land so it’s pretty big and a couple of my family members live there, but at that time nobody was home. When our dog found out my grandmother fell, he ran all around to look for another person. When he didn’t find anyone, he lay down and sat with her until she found the strength to stand up again. She told the whole family and I think we were all a little more thankful he was there for her that day.

My cat is a fucking sadist. She has learned my work/school schedule and if I'm not getting up in the morning, she will step on the button of my CPAP machine, causing me took choke and wake up. If I have a panic attack, she meows until I pick her up and pet her, until I calm down.

I have a German Shepherd that will let me know he’s about to vomit and needs to be let out by nudging my legs, licking his lips, and then running to the back door. I’m so thankful he’s learned to try to hold in his vomit so he won’t do it in the house

My cat gets really ashamed when he hacks up a hairball.  He will sit there looking very sad until its cleaned up.   Well one day I was at work when he threw one up, and since there was nobody in the house to clean it up for him, he tried to clean/cover it up it on his own.  He found one of my dirty socks I kicked off the day before, unrolled it, and then neatly placed it over the hairball.  I still ended up stepping in it though...

I once had a dog that would look both ways before crossing the street. She was legitimately looking for oncoming traffic.  One time she started to cross, but then saw a car coming. She backed off, and only crossed after the car passed.

On the other hand, I once had a dog who would sun bath in the middle of the street. Literally in the middle, as to block traffic in both directions.

We have smooth wood floors that can be kind of slippery in socks. One night I took a corner too fast, slipped, and went down hard. I wasn't hurt, just sorta stunned so I just stayed on the floor for a second (I was belly-side down, but propped up on my elbow). When I didn't get up right away, my dog leapt over the couch to get to me, wiggled her body under mine then stood up, so that she was kind of lifting my body up on hers. I'm not sure if it was at all her intention, but I like to think she was trying to help me. As soon as I got up on my own, she proceeded to tackle me and frantically lick my face in celebration. :)

Edit: Thanks for the upvotes! Since she basically saved my life I thought I'd add in a [picture of my good pupper](http://imgur.com/7gM8myD) enjoying some dirt. Further proof that this is the smartest thing she's done!

One time my dog had a minor blockage and we took him to the emergency vet to see what we could do. The vet decided to give him some fluids to try to flush it out.

Thanks for not doing that in the house buddy.

My male quaker parrot managed to get out of his cage one day and had free roam over the entire house.  He stole every pen, pencil, and hair tie he could find and built a nest in the corner of his cage.

When we tried to take it down he guarded it with his life and screeched at us.  We got him a few boxes of pencils the next day and let him remodel as much as he wanted.

Honestly he loved building it and fixing it up, it kept him busy and happy.

My cat has this thing about drinking water from a bowl. She would always tip it over lick it off the floor. 

We got tired of stepping on a wet floor in socks on the daily so we wedged the water bowl between two heavier objects so that she couldn't tip it over. 

She realized she could get a running start to jump onto a rolling office chair to create enough force to move the bowl enough to spill it onto the floor. 

I feel like she has a pretty good grasp on simple physics and using tools to get her way.

Edit: this was a couple of years ago and I did end up getting her a little fountain to drink from! She and her little sister have their own fountain and we haven't had any issues since.

One of my pet rats was kinda smart. When they would walk around on my bed, they were able to step onto the windowsill. I used to have blinds in front of my window, and the little cord hung over it down to the ground. At the end of the cord there was this little weight.

So my pet rat tried to lift the cord upward, but when of course it kept falling back down because of the little weight. He thought for a minute, and then lifted the cord again, put his front paw on the cord, gripped another part of the cord with his teeth, lifted it upward a little further, put his paw on top of it, etc. He managed to get the rest of the cord and little weight on the windowsill. He did that every day after that.

I thought that was pretty smart. 

Also, I used to have 2 rats that could spin around their axis on command. They knew they would get a snack if they did that.
So whenever I opened a bag of potato chips (for myself!) They started spinning around like 10 times hoping they would get some. I never give my rats chips, for the record.

Our late Italian Greyhound Elon got baths every week due to “THE STENCH” (his nickname was “The Stink”). One time, we were both sick with sinus infections and it had been about two weeks since Elon had gotten his bath. We were sitting on the sofa watching TV as a family, and Elon gets up off the couch and trots down the hall. This happened often, so we didn’t move. We then heard his nails on a different surface than we’d ever heard previously. Perplexed, his Dad and I went down the hall to find him standing in the bathtub staring at us like, “People I can smell myself. It’s time.”

The smartest thing I've seen my cat do is referee when my girlfriend's kitten was trying to fight her older cat. We were initially terrified because my cat was found as a stray and you can tell that he's had his ass kicked in a few fights back in the day.

When we adopted him, when he'd hear the other cats start playfighting, he'd rush out to be there too. He weighed about twice as much as the next biggest cat, and we knew almost nothing about his personality at the time, so of course this filled us with terror. Well, we followed him out into the next room, and he had just managed to perch himself on the coffee table, above the action, and was just watching.

When the older cat switched from playing to getting genuinely exasperated with the kitten, he tagged in so the other cat could get away. For months he would do this, so we figured he may have helped raise kittens when he was stray.

Anyway, his personality is great, and he's a sweet dumb boy and the best lap cat you could ask for. The vet at the shelter thought he would want to be an outside cat, but once we got him home it was very plain that that was not the case. I could leave the door open all day and he wouldn't go anywhere; this cat has no interest in being outdoors again.

I'm babbling but the point is I love this dumb boi.

I have a blood parrot, smartest fish I've ever had. His tank contains half sand and half white pebbles. However he's very particular with where and how the floor of his environment looks like. For example, he'll move plants towards certain places if he doesn't like how the ground looks beneath them. He'll place pebbles on the sand part, and make a sand pile in the pebbles area. But it isn't random, if you remove a pebble from a little pile, he'll notice it and place another one. If you destort a little sand pile, he'll build more ontop of the remains. He'll spend about three days carving out a small hole just to see his reflection at the bottom of the tank. If you lightly dusty the empty space with sand, he'll come swimming out of his 'house,' collect the misplaced sand in his mouth and literally throw it at you against the aquarium glass. He's a very grumpy fish, but his personality is amazing!

I've got an African Grey parrot. I also have a large mirror that leans against a wall. He once walked up to it, studied the other bird intensely after fluffing up and acting like a badass. Then he decided to look behind the mirror for the other bird. Except you could see the confusion when he popped his head behind there only to see nothing. He then looked at me as if I caused this black magic. Then he proceeded to walk behind the mirror and poke his head around so he could look into the mirror while standing behind it. He then looked at me quizzically, studied the mirror, popped his head behind it, popped it back out to confirm, then just walked away. Now, he seems to check himself out in the mirror every time he waddles past it. I swear he knows it's him in the mirror and nit just that particular one. If he's in the bathroom with me, he acts the same and appears to be studying himself whenever he gets the chance.

Knowing that the reflection in a mirror is you is one of the rare abilities in the animal kingdom and one which few animals possess the required intelligence to understand. Dolphins, pigs, some of the higher level primates. That's about it. Most other animals can't put the connection together. 

He also used to taunt the cat and get him to jump on top of the bird's cage. Then he'd yell for us so we'd grab the cat and scold him. Then the bird would laugh. Happened until the cat learned not to jump on top of the cage. Now, he's scared of the bird and will turn around if he sees the bird walking towards him.

When my son was a baby, he was teething really bad. Constantly running a fever and cranky. we gave him lots of the tylenol suspension drops. One morning I had the baby wedged in the recliner while I was looking for something. Of course he was crying. Our dog, looked at the baby, ran upstairs, came back down a few seconds later with the tylenol, dropped it in the recliner where it rolled to the baby. Then the dog turned to me and barked until I picked it up.

One of my dogs would walk next to me without a leash and no matter what he would never bark or leave.
 All I did was give him attention and take good care of him, he learned all this stuff by observing my behavior.

My samoyed knows he can use his nose to turn off my Xbox and get my attention. He always gets a drink of water before going on a walk.

My Golden Retriever has created a game, we call it Brody-Ball. Basically he gets a tennis ball between his paws while he’s laying on the couch or bed, and slowly starts to nudge it towards the edge. Once it gets to a point where it’s balancing, he tries to stay perfectly still until it starts to fall. Once it starts to fall he either wins, by snagging the ball before it falls to the ground, or he loses, by failing to catch it and it falling off the couch/bed. I think he just did this to counteract the boredom he had when he was a lonely pup. 

Edit: Dogs name is Brody, hence the “Brody” in “Brody-Ball”!

My golden retriever leaves a shoe on the bed, without fail, for my wife or I to find if we are both gone at the same time.  My theory is that she did it once, and we came home, so now she does it every time we leave to ensure that we come back.  Like a doggy superstition.   

After doing this for years, my wife had to leave the state for a week.  My first day back from work, there was a shoe on the bed.  Normal.  After my second day back (wife is still gone), there were three shoes on the bed.  After my third day returning from work alone, every shoe and boot in the house was laid out on the bed and couches, and all of my wife's dirty socks were in a bowl.

It may not be the smartest thing she's ever done, but it really made me think about how she thinks.

This is a completely true story. Weird, but true, and shows a really impressive level of intelligence in my cat. It happened when I was a teenager.

I’m sitting on the couch, and my cat walks into the room and starts meowing loudly, but not coming to me. So I stand up and go toward him, and he starts walking away, so I follow. He leads me, meowing the whole way and looking back to make sure I’m following, to the bathroom. Weird, right? Just wait.

So we’re in the bathroom, and he hops up on the toilet and, get this, he PEES IN IT. I was floored. One, he peed in the toilet. Like a person. He’d never done that before. It’s impressive that he knew what a toilet was for. But two, he brought me there to show me. Why? This is where the real intelligence comes into it. 

Well, he stops peeing and turns to look into the toilet and then looks at me. So I look in the toilet. It’s full of blood. He had a terrible kidney infection (as the vet later confirmed), and this is how he told me.

Think of all the things he had to understand to do this!! He had to know he was sick and in which part of his body the infection was. He had to know that the bathroom was the place where I deal with the part of my body that matches up with his sick part. He had to know what a toilet was for and how to use it. And he knew that if I understood the problem, I’d be able to fix it. 

Seriously, that cat was incredible.

Maybe this is more just awww... but I also have a pug so you're not going to get rocket science from him. 

I moved back in with my dad for awhile between houses and he has a big pool. I decided to make the most of my summer and stocked up on books and a floaty lounger thing that had a pillow but was basically like pool noodles holding a net. I still insist this is the best pool reading lounger because you don't get too hot. 

Well the pug likes to snuggle. He also can't handle a Missouri summer so he can't be outside for long. Dad let him out because he was crying and he finds me in the pool. I'm like... no dude, there are no snuggles here. 

Well, you could see him thinking about this situation. He sat for a few minutes and just looked at me. Then he jumped in, paddled over,  got up on the lounger with his body in the water (on the net still, but because of how this works, you're supported but submerged in that makes sense. He propped his head on my belly and proceeds to fall asleep snuggling. 

So that's how we spent our summer. He figured out a way to combat heat and pool just to sleep with his head on me. It might not be smart smart... but he had a will and found a way.

At the end of a peanut butter jar I give it to my Doberman to lick the inside out. But it’s kinda hard for him to hold the jar still and also have the right angle, so one time he found a high top shoe of mine and set the jar in it so it would stand up right while he licked it clean. I was sure it was a weird coincidence but since then he always goes looking for my work boots when I give him a peanut butter jar, he’ll even set the boot upright if it’s knocked over then proceed to insert the jar. 
Not as impressive as some of the feats on this thread, but it blew my mind a little.

When he psyched out another dog. I had a foster greyhound, Roadie, and my grey, Catch. Roadie stole Catch’s favorite toy and was not about to share it. Catch went to the toy basket, grabbed a random toy, and started tossing it around and playing with it like it was the greatest toy on earth.

Then he paused for a moment and looked at Roadie (who was laying in the couch with the coveted toy). I suspect he was checking to see if Roadie was watching, which he was. 

He tossed around the toy more and threw it up into the air and caught it.

Check back to see if Roadie was watching. He was captivated. 

Tossed around the toy more, shook his head, chomped on it a few more times.

Roadie jumped off the couch and took the toy away from Catch. But it didn’t matter, you see, because Catch dove on to the couch and snagged back his favorite toy. 

He’s a smart boye.

I turned to go back to my chores and Ping let out a howl I didn’t think he was capable of and as I turned my son was seizing, full grand mal seizures that I recall clearly 11 years later.

I've returned more than once to have him greet me at the door. He waited until we were gone to get out. He's so used to being everywhere with me that I assume he took it upon himself to try and follow us haha

I always thought Pepe was dumb to never fight back. Until one day when I noticed Middy wouldn't go through the cat door anymore. Thought that was strange. Went to pet Middy and came to realize his whiskers were all missing. Come to find every time Pepe grooms Middy, he bites his whiskers off in between licks. Revenge level: EXPERT. Meticulous planning, patience and strategic genius of a cat.

My border collie once managed to climb all the way to the top of the cupboard in my room without falling, not exactly smart but I still don't know how he did that

There was a dog I met named Bandit who lived out on some Ranchland to the north of my hometown. Bandit was a gray black mutt- kinda like a cattle dog or a heeler. 

Anyway, the winters here get pretty brutal, and Bandit would hunt for himself and the other ranch dogs, they would corner foxes, rabbits, all sorts.

One frosty morning the other dogs were whining and crying because they had no water- it had frozen over and they couldn't just stick their nose to the ice and drink. I followed one of the dogs round the side of the house and found their frozen bowls.

Bandit found some pieces of earth or rocks or whatever, and he figured how heavy they needed to be to break the surface ice so that he could drink. Sometimes he would even jump slightly onto his back legs so the rock would fall further.

He did that for 6 years following, I'm told.

That, imo is the smartest dog I had ever met.

When my dog feels like he isn't getting my full undivided attention, he will lock himself in the bathroom on purpose and start to cry/whine. He knows that I will go and open the door for him. Other than that he is a good pup.

Was dog sitting my friend's sheltie for a few weeks. We were on a walk and he noticed my shoe lace was untied. He stopped walking and barked at it. I tied my shoe and we kept going. He also poked me with his nose to let me know he wants something and then looks or walks to what he wants (like an empty water bowl). Very smart and aware of this surroundings.

My black lab rings a bell that we leave on the floor every time she wants to go outside or get a treat, she has  definitely abused the system to get loads of treats.

Whenever my puppy gets too much for my parents yorkie (who's still kinda my pet since I take care of her all the time,) the yorkie will look through the glass door to the yard and bark.  My puppy then assumes something's outside, demands to go out, and the Yorkie gets five minutes of peace.

I had a male cat which had the habit of hanging out in the bathroom with me when I used the toilet.

At the time I also had a habit of leaving the roll of toilet paper on the floor instead of on the holder...

Cut to some time in the past, I'm in the middle of a healthy bowel movement when in struts my cat.  

"Meow," he says as he stops dead in front of me then immediately proceeds to clean himself.

"Dude," I say to him, "I'm trying to poop, I don't wanna watch or listen to you licking your ass."

He stops, stands, turns his back to me, gives me a cat look over his shoulder and goes back to town like problem solved.

So I upped the ante.  I gave him 30 seconds to lull himself into a false sense of security... then "BOO!" as I reached down and touched his sides with my hands. 

Up he jumped, to the door he ran and at the threshold he sat.  I knew I had screwed up, I was getting another cat look which definitely told me I was in trouble.

I apologize, and he seems to accept it. He slowly approaches me while I'm still sitting there on the toilet, pants around my ankles, helpless as he counts to 30 lulling me into my own false sense of security...

Suddenly he strikes, but not at me, instead and without warning he grabs the roll of toilet paper sitting on the floor and in a single bound is back at the bathroom threshold. He gives me 2 seconds for my situation to sink in before he lies on his back, roll firmly grasped in his mouth and proceeds to use all four claws to shred my last roll of toilet paper into confetti.

He stands, drops what's left in his mouth on the floor, cat looks me one last time, turns and slowly walks off.

TL;DR I scared my cat, he revenge destroyed my toilet paper right in front of me.

My miniature schnauzer is supposed to pee on the right side of the house. For some reason, he prefers the left side. To correct this behaviour, we started giving him treats when he did his doodoo on the right side. He would get treats everyday. That is, until we noticed the right side was of a vibrant green while the left side was covered in brown stacks. We decided to spy on him. 
Turns out, he would walk to the right side, wait about a minute and sprint to the other side. Every. Day.
That same dog also just ate his vomit so I don't have to pick it up.

My cat Wally has impressed me a few times. 

If he gets sick and Im not home, he'll meow at me when I get home & lead me to it. 

If he is thirsty and I drink from water bottle, he'll climb up on me to try & drink from it. 

He will bring me toys to throw for him to play with. 

He will sit next to the water faucet & meow to tell me to turn it on. 

He will wake me up by pawing my mouth to tell me he is hungry. 

I love him.

About a month ago my roommates cat Waffles  started acting crazy one night. Kept meowing and perched herself on the entertainment center and just wouldn't stop meowing. We checked her food, etc, and couldn't figure out why. About an hour goes by and she won't stop, then I hear a very faint meow from afar. I finally realize that I can't find my cat Poofy. We search the whole house and I eventually find her locked in the garage! Waffles was trying to warn us and we had no idea!

My 4 year old cat is intelligent to an almost concerning level. 

As a kitten, she figured out how the door knob (lever) to our apartment worked, so if either of us left, she’d run, jump, and pull the lever down. Luckily, she couldn’t pull the door in. She will open doors in our current house, though, since she’s now tall enough to reach and turn the knob while standing on her hind legs. 

She also too easily figured out how the treat dispensing egg toys work: she batted at one once, ate the treat, then rolled on her back while holding it in both paws and shook the rest of the treats directly into her mouth until they were gone. She will also grab individual treats or bits of kibble in her paw and put them in her mouth instead of lowering her face to the food (though she doesn’t do this with wet food). 

She understands how the window locks in the house work. In particular, we have a shelf for the cats to sit on in one of the windows in our bedroom. She can partially lift the cordless blinds to look out. She knows which way the lock points for locked, and has managed to halfway unlock it before. If it’s unlocked, she just paws at the window as if she’s pushing it open. Luckily it’s too heavy for her. She also hisses at us if we lock the already closed window when she wanted us to open it instead. 

The last example I can think of right now is she knows where the vet is. We often take the cats in the car to different places, or occasionally just for a ride in the car since they like watching out the window (from their carriers, of course). She’s always fine until she sees the sign for the vet. She remembers what it looks like, and gets visibly upset staring at the sign when we turn into the parking lot. She doesn’t get upset when we pull into any other parking lot or driveway. 

She’s an awesome cat, and is very loving to her family. She can be a spoiled princess, especially to everyone else, but I love her so much. Our other cat is really dumb, so it’s a fun dynamic.

The night we had to put my golden retriever down, we had taken him to the emergency vet for severely declining during the evening. Before he was to undergo emergency surgery, the vet walked him out to say goodbye just in case something were to happen during the procedure. It was around 4am and my whole family was in the waiting room bleary-eyed from crying. 

We were sitting in a semi-circle when he walked out and he took his time laying his head in each of our laps, one by one, not missing a beat. He stayed in each lap for about 3 minutes, let us hug and kiss him goodbye, and then moved on to the next family member, 5 in total. Then, the vet walked him back and he didn't come back. 

I believe this was him understanding it was his time to go. My whole family agrees, we have never been more touched by the intelligence of him, just hours before his death. It ended up being cancer and he was only 9. 

I miss you, Dusty.

I have a cat who isn't very touchy-feely, doesn't show a ton of affection, etc. A friend of mine who has epilepsy was staying at my house and had an episode while no one was around. According to her, when she regained conciousness, my cat was licking her and giving her affection the rest of the day, as if he knew something was wrong. Something similar happened while I was crying once, my cat looked at me inquisitively and approached me, making that trilling sound that cats do when they're greeting you, and rubbed against me.

This is a story of revenge. I had a bromance going on with our English Bulldog, Rosco. Every once in awhile he would need to be put in his place though. One such occasion, he was getting rough with the family cat. When I tried to break it up, Rosco got lippy with me. Ok, so in the kennel he went to settle down and think about what he did. After he was done huffing and puffing, I let him out. He immediately ran back to my room. I didn’t think anything of it because he would spend a lot of time in there with me anyway. I figured he was just going back to get away from everyone and be in a safe space. Fast forward a couple of hours, it’s time for bed. I head to my room, Rosco isn’t in there, nothing unusual. I climb into my unmade bed and get settled in. I curl my toes around something soft and squishy. Genuinely not knowing what the hell it was, I flip on the bedside lamp and throw back the covers. In between every single one of my toes is creamy dog poop. I look toward the door, pretty pissed that the dog has defecated in the bed, and Rosco is standing in the door way. He gives me one of those bulldog snorts and trots off. I’m convinced he revenge pooped under the sheets after I had kenneled him for messing with the cat.

My ragdoll is ridiculously clever. He is 12 now so his brilliance is fleeting but every once in a while he still surprises me. When I first adopted him, I lived alone in a small apartment. I was all excited to have a pal so I kept buying him all kinds of fancy treats, only to come home and find them gone. (I tried high cupboards, tupperware, hiding them behind things.. didn't really matter so I just gave up trying to deter him)

For a while, I put them in the middle of a set of three heavy drawers and would come home to the package devoured and no evidence of the drawers being moved. For science, I kept planting treats to see if I could catch him in the act. Sure enough, one day I come home and notice the bottom of the 3 drawers is ajar. I slowly open the middle drawer and it all makes sense. He has been opening the bottom drawer, crawling up through the back, eating the treats and closing the bottom drawer behind him to destroy the evidence. 

I also have auto immune diseases and this same cat has slept beside me completely devoted for sometimes days at a time and has thrown a fit to alert my husband where I am when I was so sick I couldn't move/needed to go to the hospital, ect. He's a great kitty.

When my dog was still a puppy, she would always dig through the trash in the bathroom to chew on toilet paper. One day, my dad got us a motion sensed trash can that opened when you waved you hand over it and closed automatically. One day I come in to see my pug move her head over the trash bin and start taking out toilet paper... needless to say this dog is too smart for all of us.

Ellie (a cat) will run to check on me or my fiance if we ever make a surprised, frightened or scared noise. She's very protective of us and I honestly think if someone broke into our house she'd attack them. She also comes when called and she'll tap on the top of her treat container when she wants one. Not always, but most of the time if I'm sitting on the couch  and if I say "sit on my lap???" She'll jump up and sit on me.

To preface: this cat is a fucking idiot. I genuinely believe there's something wrong with him because he's so dumb. But he has his moments.

So, Loki has learned how to knock. Just very specifically on the bathroom door, and he only does it when I'm in there. If he hears me go to the bathroom without him, he'll sit there and "tap tap tap. tap tap tap tap" until I let him in.

He's also learned to turn on the touch activated cat toy, and even knows how many taps he needs to use to put it on his favorite speed and how many to turn it off.

May not be as special since I hear of other animals doing it, but he knows when something's wrong with me and makes damn sure to let me know.

Earlier this year, I had an ovarian cyst start to rupture. It was bleeding out into my belly, and by the time I had surgery to remove it, my ovary had no blood flow and was starting to die. I dealt with it for almost 3 days because the ER docs were like "lmao I touched your belly and couldn't find anything so here's some pain meds". 

The day after it ruptured, boyfriend and I came home from work and I wasn't feeling too hot. Loki was immediately all over me, and when we shut him out of the room, he freaked out and meowed like we'd never heard him do before. The moment we let him in, her was back all over me. Same thing happened the next night before I went to the ER the first time. When they didn't do much, I went back the next day and asked for a CT and an ultrasound. Three ultrasounds later, I was admitted for the ruptured cyst and dying ovary. Had the surgery the next morning, was home by that night.

When I got home, Loki was fine. Curled up at my side and went to sleep. No more panicking, no more terrifying meows. My baby knew something was wrong, and made sure to let me know. Sweet boy is currently curled up against my side. I love him. He's perfect.

We never close the gate and she never leaves the yard. We didn’t train her to do that, she just stays. Even when people walk by.

My yellow lab can open cabinets, drawers, etc. despite the child locks we put on them to keep her out. She would take things like the TV remote, kitchen utensils, your phone, things like that. She knows that if she chews them up and destroys them, she gets in trouble. So instead, she will go get a spatula (for instance), come into the living room to show you she has something you don't want her to have, and then runs off hoping you'll chase after her.

Before I moved out, my family dog would follow my mom to bed, wait for her to fall asleep, and then sneak to my room and sleep with me through the night. Then, early in the morning, would sneak back into my parent's room and pretend he had slept there the whole night. Took me several months to convince my mom he was cheating on her. Lol.

Our dog escaped the yard one morning and came back an hour later carrying a loaf of bread in his mouth.

I used to have an aquarium in my office. I've also got two cats. I'd close the office door when I left in the morning for work. Occasionally I would lock one cat in the office for the day.

One day this happened. When I got home, I couldn't hear the cat, and she didn't come greet me as usual. I opened the office door and she ran out meowing up a storm. I figured I would find a pile of cat shit somewhere, but the cat proved she's far too smart. She dragged a bag of aquarium gravel off the stand, and out about 4 feet. She then proceeded to shred the top off the bag, and used it as a litter box. I couldn't be mad, I was impressed.

She got lots of treats that night.

We had 2 cats, snickers and tiger. They did not like each other. It was much a "I tolerate you" attitude from snickers to tiger. One day snickers was walking around us crying. He was a pretty quiet cat so this was unusual and annoying. So I, being a young kid, thought chasing him would make him shut up. He bolts for the basement and I follow him and soon he jumps up on a file cabinet that is right underneath a small window. I look up and there is tiger, on the other side of the window. He managed to sneak out and didn't know how to get back in. It was a cold Feb night in Michigan so he was huddled by the window I think for warmth. Anyway as soon as I saw that I raced outside to get him. I was pretty surprised snickers cared at all to tell us tiger was outside but it was very clear he was taking me there despite my unorthodox way of getting there

We feed one of our dogs in the bathroom due to her being a little food aggressive. When we traveled to our family’s house for thanksgiving, we were getting their food out and she immediately ran to the bathroom there so that she would get fed.

We had a husky growing up when I was much younger. She was a master escape artist. Without fail we would come home to find her sleeping on the front steps waiting for us. She somehow would find a way to scale our basement wall and sneak out the window. One time we did catch her caught in the blinds. I believe that was the last time she tried that route.

I'm sure this is getting posted way too late to get any attention, but several years ago when the Twilight movies were still a thing, my wife had a friend who was completely geeking out over them.  She insisted  that if we all just watched the movies we would see how awesome they were and stop making fun of her about it.  We eventually relented and her husband and decided to make a drinking game out of and we take a drink everytime one of the actors stared dramatically at the camera.  About half way through the film, the husband and I were smashed, my wife was playing with her phone and it was pretty clear that none of us were coming around.  It was at this point, that my oldest dog got off the couch, sauntered over to the PlayStation and pressed the eject button with her nose.  The movie popped out and she tiredly walked back to the couch and laid back down.  This was the first and only time she showed any interest in the TV or game consoles.

My cat kept laying on my sore swollen leg after I got home from giving birth. Turns out, I had developed a fairly large DVT behind my knee that extended into the thigh and calf. The Drs didn’t even think anything was wrong until my ultrasound came back. The cat did. ♥️ same cat also places her paw on my son’s head when he starts to fuss and meows if he wakes up and I’m in the shower.

My brothers fat indoor cat got outside and stuck up in a tree higher then we could climb and he didn’t know how to get her down. After a few minutes, I brought my cat outside and told him to go get her down. He scaled the tree and led her down one bough at a time, looking back at her and meowing to have her follow him. Hands down, the BEST cat any of my friends or family had ever known.

We had an Acura MDX and when we took our dog Lucy to the park we let her just chill in the back with the seats down and when the seats were down the seatbelts were still there just kind of sitting. So our dog would get in and then see us put on our seatbelt and so she would get behind the seatbelt and tuck herself in. Even though it didn’t help at all because it wasn’t clicked in it was still cute as all hell. Oh and she looked both ways before crossing because she saw us do it. We miss you Lucy, hope doggy heaven is treating you well <3

My little springer spaniel, Ellie about 5 months old learned how to open all the doors in the house. It wasn't long before she figured out where the food was. My dad thought I was over feeding her because she was gaining a significant amount of weight compared to the other dog. One night I caught her opening my bedroom door and then walking into the kitchen, then into the pantry. When I walked from behind half of her body was in the bag of dog food.

One of our cats is nicknamed The Mechanical Engineer because we had to install childproof locks on the cabinet doors. She's figured out how to open desk drawers and dresser drawers when she wants to get something, and lately has begun attempting to cover her tracks by closing drawers once she's done. There's still a pile of stuff on the floor so it's pretty obvious, but it's cute.

Usually whatever she was really looking to take ends up in her food bowl. She steals hair elastics a lot. So I've hidden hair elastics away in strange places such as on top of the shower stall. Ten minutes later there's a thud and a little cat is carrying a hair elastic through the hallway to the kitchen.

Sometimes when she's stolen a small shiny item she hides it in her mouth until she thinks we can't see her, then lets go of it to play. There's an amethyst ring I haven't seen in a few months. It may turn up behind a sofa years from now.

She even understands how the lock on her cat carrier works and she's tried to free herself when we've taken her to the vet. Fortunately she isn't strong enough to operate that mechanism but she's spent several minutes trying to push it, and you can tell from how she's angled her paws that she knows which way it opens.

One if my dogs, Touya, gets very excited when she has a toy in her mouth. She'll bring it to you and, without fail, run away when you try to take it, her entire body wriggling from tall wagging. She's very small and wily, so she's always too quick for me to take them and throw them for her. 

One morning I started having a panic attack. Didn't want to wake my husband (he hadn't been getting much sleep), so went to sit on the stairs and cry. This dog is always overexcited when I'm sitting low enough for her to weasel her way into my lap for pets, but she calmly came up and snuggled my side to comfort me. Then, she gets up again, goes and gets a toy, and comes back (shimmying excitedly, as usual). This time, however, when I reached for our she actually let me take it from her. I think I was so stunned that I stopped freaking out and just started laughing.  She proceeded to do this with the rest of her toys for the next hour until my husband woke up.  Turned into one of the happiest mornings for me. 

I guess she must have thought, "you need these more than I do, human. Feel better please."

When I was 12 my dad had a heart attack, and a quadruple bypass. When he came home, his chest was wired shut and it reaaaallllyyy hurt to cough. They gave him a small pillow to clutch to his chest to relieve some of the pain. When he went to bed, the pain of coughing would wake him up. So my dog picked up on this and would shove his head into my dad's chest everyone he coughed in bed. It was nuts and it helped my father get through it. Very good dog.

My last dog was a Husky Black Lab mix - all dark coat, thick curly tail and white husky eyes - she was gorgeous. Everybody has a "my dog is/was the  best dog ever story" and I love that about dogs. Well, our dog really was the best dog ever. We lived on a fish hatchery and she was one  radiant, happy af doggo. 
As she got older she mostly just slowed down, not too many health issues thankfully. When she was 13, I was out of town for work for about 2 weeks. I would Skype my kids and Bear every day or so (of course the kids named her bear:) while I was away. One Sunday, Father's day Sunday in fact, we all had a lenghty, fun Skype session. The kids told me about my dad surprise visiting them earlier in the week. My mom stopping by the day before for ice cream and the dinner they just had with all of Mom's family that afternoon. Bear hung out during the entire Skype session. She often would get weirded out, howl a bit - her way of saying hello -and then go find something else to do.
We ended the Skype call and I got another, heavier call about 3 hours later. Bear went into the back yard after the Skype session, laid down under our tree and didn't get back up. Just like that, she passed. 
I found out years later that snow dogs will often walk out into the ice and just die when they are old and no longer see that they are needed in the pack. Bear literally waited until she could say goodbye to every single person in the family, and then chose to exit peacefully. Next level intelligence

We have a German Shepherd, and he is simply the greatest dog we've ever owned to date. My husband served in the Marines for 13 years. As you can imagine, 13 years in the military takes quite a hefty physical toll on the body. His back is in constant pain, and his knees are terrible. Without any training whatsoever, our German Shepherd taught himself to help my husband up the stairs. He allows my husband to grab onto his collar, and will go slowly, one stair at a time, making sure my husband maintains balance, and will even brace himself against my husband to ensure he stays upright.  Each and every time my husband goes to the stairs our dog will run right over to his side, and will wait for him to grab his collar. 

Genius animal, and such a cherished member of our family.

It was a fairly new house so the window wells didn’t have covers on them, my brother was running straight for the open window well, I started to chase after him and could catch because I was on the other side of the yard, my Golden Retriever say this ran over and knocked my little brother over to stop him, it wasn’t hard just enough force to push him on his butt, if my dog didn’t notice he would’ve fallen into the window well and gotten seriously hurt.

I have rly bad ptsd and my cat knows when I’m about to have a panic attack. Like sometimes I get into this weird dissociative space before and I’m not really freaking out yet and she can be in the other room sleeping and she will come into where I am and start pawing at me and start demanding all of my attention and it will usually help pull me out of it. She wasn’t always so great with that stuff but she got better with picking up on my moods as she got older. I wish she was good in public spaces but she’s afraid of the wind so that rules her out as an emotional support cat 😂

I used to have a Samoyed.

When she was a puppy she was allowed on the couch. Later we came up with a rule saying she was no longer on the couch. I was mowing the lawn one day and looked inside and saw she was sitting on the couch. A few minutes later, I went inside the house and saw that she was no longer on the couch.

At some point, whenever my mother got groceries she would also buy a doggie treat. She would tell her "I got you something!" and she would excitedly eat the treat. It didn't take her long to figure out "groceries = treat" so she would excitedly expect a treat whenever somebody came in with groceries.

I owned an Akida that could open doors. Even with round knobs. He was a service dog, and his old lady passed away after falling in the shower. So whenever either of us was in the shower or bath he'd let himself in and keep watch. If it was a bath, he'd sniff you every so often to make sure you were okay.

He could also use the faucets and would lock the cats in the closet.

When my dog peed on the floor, I was passed at him (naturally) and punished him. He then came up to me with droopy ears looking down with something in his mouth. He drops it down and it turns out it's some of his meat from his lunch, and he just looked at me with those puppy eyes and I couldn't resist hugging him. He was happy right after that 👍

My cat does a lot of small things that make me think she’s actually very intelligent. She plays fetch. But will also play with herself. She’ll pick her toy up and throw it and run to catch it. Or hide it behind a curtain, go to the other end of the room and sneak up and “attack” it. There have been multiple times where I’ll get home from work and once she sees me she’ll grab a litter bag and bring it to her box to let me know to scoop it. I always scoop it once a day, she’s just reminding me haha. She knows that the ropes on the curtain raise it up, so if she wants to see out the window, she’ll pull on the curtains to try and lift hem up. I’m sure there’s more but those are a few I can think of off the top of my head.
